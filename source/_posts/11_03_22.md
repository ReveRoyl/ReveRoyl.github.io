# What can functional connectivity tell us about cognition and behaviour?

## Objective

- Describe different approaches to studying human functional connectivity
- Outline the organisation of the brain into intrinsic connectivity networks, 
  and their relationship to cognition
- Provide examples of methods to study links between functional connectivity and behaviour & cognition

# Cognitive neuroscience of cognitive control

## Cognitive control functions

- Motor response inhibition: the ability to inhibit a prepotent motor response
  - Go/no-go task
  - Stop task
- Interfere nee inhibition: the ability to inhibit a prepotent tendency to respond to an
  interfering stimulus/overriding a conflicting motor response
  - Simon task
  - Eriksen Flanker task
  - Colour-Word Stroop task
- Cognitive flexibility: the ability to inhibit a response that is no longer appropriate &
  reengage 1n a new response
  - Wisconsin Card Sorting task
  - Other switching tasks; STOP-Change task

TDCS is cheaper than TMS

## Overall conclusions

1. Lateral & medial fronto-striatal areas mediate cognitive control
   - R IFG, pre-SMA, caudate, subthal. nucleus for motor inhibition
   - R & L IFG, caudate, ACC for interference inhibition
   - R & L DLPFC/IFG, R & L IPL, basal ganglia for switching
   - Anterior insula is crucial for saliency processing
2. There is progressive increase in activation of areas that mediate <u>development</u> (not sure)
   - these functions from childhood to adulthood
   - R IFG, SMA, caudate, subthalamic nucleus for inhibition
   - R & L IFG, caudate, ACC for interference inhibition
   - L & R IFG, L & R IPL, basal ganglia for switching
3. ADHD patients have functional deficits in these areas
   - R IFG/ AI, SMA/ ACC, caudate, thal for motor/interference inh.
   - R & L IFG, basal ganglia for switching
   - =>likely a delay of neurofunctional maturation?
