# Mocap

## Objective

1. Name the key principle that has remained unchanged in the history of motion capture

2. Explain key terminology relating to motion capture

3. Identify the types of motion capture systems available and outline advantages and disadvantages

4. Describe some applications of motion capture, in particular in Psychology

5. Using an inertial system, describe the process of data collection and data processing


How can we describe movement?

We can use: lively vs agitated

but not precise and reliable

Definition of motion capture: Recording the motion as 3d data for analysis, playback and remapping

usually interchangeably 

## A few keywords

rigid object

Degree of freedom (DOF): numbers of dimensions that are tracked: position & orientation = 3 directions +3 orientations =6 DOF

Kinematic model

Sample rate: how often (per second are data collected). Note that any analyses of movement from a recording/video (e.g. markerless MoCap) is constrained to the framerate of the video.

# Neuroimaging of ASD II (COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE OF AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS)

## Objectives

1. Classify the main diagnostic criteria of autism spectrum disorders (ASD)
2. Describe different factors of heterogeneity in ASD
3. Explain and summarise current as well as future strategies to overcome the problem of individual variability in ASD using cognitive neuroscientific approaches

## Autism spectrum disorders (ASD)

Prevalence: 1% of more than 5.5 million in EU; Gender ratio: 4:1 male to female.

Diagnosis: Neurodevelopment diagnosis.



Individual variability among clinical and cognitive symptoms

Neuroimaging findings across the lifespan

Excitotoxicity in brains of individuals with ASD due to an excess of Glutamate

Glutamate and/or Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) markers could become a biomarker for ASD

## Summary

**ASD**

- Relatively common and dimensional condition
- Lifelong condition
- Underdiagnosed in females
- Typically accompanied by co-occurring mental health conditions
- Multi-factorial risk factors and causes
- Neurodevelopmental disorder

**Clinical and research approaches have changed accordingly**

- Greater awareness of heterogeneity
- Increasing emphasis on large sample size
- Use of autism trait measures with subclinical groups

**Neuroimaging research**

- Revealed brain phenotypes associated with ASD across the lifespan
- Evidence for brain overgrowth, alterations in brain volume, structural and functional patterns

**Future research**

- Lack of understanding of the underlying neurobiological mechanisms -No evidence in treatment yet
- Use of new technology to include individuals with ASD with intellectual and/or language impairments
- Address the historical imbalance in participant gender
- Study ASD in low and middle income countries
- Balance big data with deep phenotyping as well as prediction tools for predicting diagnostic and dimensional outcomes

# Vocabulary

**PDD:** pervasive developmental disorder

**RRBIs:** Restricted and repetitive behavioural interests
