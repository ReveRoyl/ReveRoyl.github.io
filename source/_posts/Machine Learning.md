# Machine Learning for League of Legend mini-map

## Technical Details:

General idea: Use node script to detect whenever the Mysterious Web Socket is open, listen to the incoming data and save the result as JSON file.

1. In order to run a supervised learning, another problem is how to **label** dataset:

   solve the problem of organizing CSV files and JPG files:

   Save the data into a **.npz** file which save all stuff as **raw numpy arrays**

2. During labelling, another problem is the data bias:

   A misrecognition could happen if there is not enough data for a certain champ.

   To avoid overfitting and underfitting for different champs: code to balance the dataset under the function check_champs

   [**Focal loss**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002) could be used to balance the dataset

3. However, how to get the time which is labelled timestamps:

   OCR: use computer vision to get the timestamp (**YOLO**), another option is Google Cloud Vision API (but need paying)

4. data augmentation could be a good method (flip the frame)but may cause confusion of the model (also flip the champsâ€™ icon).

5. One limitation is that the RAM is supposed to storage many images at once.
