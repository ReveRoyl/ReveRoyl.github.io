- ## review basic concepts about neuronal activity

  Two ways to propagate information: 1. electrical potential; 2. chemical neurotransmitters

  Generation of signals (both) only require kinetic energy already available

- ## discuss the mechanisms that lead to spontaneous electrical activity in neurons

  

- ## discuss basic concepts about neuro-transmitter function

  Restoration of electro-chemical potential requires a huge amount of **additional** energy that can only be met by increases in metabolism

  Reuptake and recycling requires a lot of additional energy from increases in metabolism

- ## discuss the energy requirements for neuronal and synaptic activity

  There are only a small amount of glycogen in brain so that a vast supply of oxygen and glucose delivered by a highly specialized vascular network is necessary

- ## discuss the control of blood flow in brain tissue and its relevance

  **Increases** in neuronal activity are always accompanied by a **local** increase in **regional Cerebral Blood Flow** (CBF)

- ## Understand the physical principles of Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) contrast

  Paramagnetic deoxyhemoglobin in venous blood is a naturally occurring contrast agent (Ogawa, 1990)

  

- ## The BOLD contrast depends on the relationship between three processes:

- ### (b) the magnetic properties of the haemoglobin in the blood

- ### (a) the increase in blood flow triggered by the increase in cellular activity

- ### (c) the mismatch between the increase in blood flow and the increase in oxygen metabolism

  BOLD contrast depends on the relationship between CBF (Cerebral Blood Flow) and CMRO2 (Cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen)

  increases in CBF, CMR~gluc~ and CMR~O2~ comes as a result of increases in neuronal activity

  However, paradoxically: the oxygen extraction fraction (E) (E = (oxygen consumed) / (oxygen delivered)) **DECREASES** with **INCREASES** in neuronal activity. 

  Increased neuronal activity leads to a **DECREASE** in the concentration of de-oxyhaemoglobin in venous space

  Why does this reactive hyperemia occur? One explanation is to transport oxygenated haemoglobin

  ## • Understand the basic methods used to assess drug effects with MRI

  

  ## • Appreciate the utility of phMRI

  ## • Understand the key differences in PET and MRI for drug effects

  PET is much more expensive even though MRI is expensive

  ## • To be able to describe solutions to confounds

We may meet some problems with building and using BOLD predictors

1. The BOLD response is delayed, has dispersed/wide and variable shape
2. BOLD signals include substantial amount of low-frequency noise
