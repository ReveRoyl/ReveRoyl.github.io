# Mock abstract exam

## Part 1

### What is the main aim of the research reported in this paper? 

Define method and clarify why this method is used in the study

give background information on aim 

### What are the main findings of this research? How could the authors further investigate them?

state the main finding



Discuss future research in the context of the current research

### Are the authors’ conclusions supported by the data? Discuss possible confounding variables. 

state if the data support the conclusion.

fully consider all confounding variables

### The authors report there was no significant main effect of stimulation, with an associated p-value of p = 0.97. What would the conclusion be if the *p*-value was 0.50? 

answer the question but provide context

show off your additional knowledge of the subject

Using your own words, describe the following:

## Part 2 

### The results obtained in this paper. Include in your answer a brief indication of the methods used

State the major findings. 30 marks.

Give key details of the methods



think more broadly -replication crisis in cognitive neuroscience is relevant here



### The significance of the results for understanding cognitive neuroscience

# Neural underpinnings of cognitive ageing

## Objectives

What is cognitive ageing and when does cognitive decline begin?

## Cognitive decline

individual- differences approaches to studying the neural basis of cognitive ageing

![cross-sectional and longitudinal ageing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202203261740132.png)

**Why do cross-sectional and longitudinal ageing studies give different results?**

1. Cohort differences (the Flynn Effect)
• Problem for cross-sectional studies
2. Nonrandom attrition
• Problem for longitudinal studies
3. Practice effects
• Problem for longitudinal studies

## Neural underpinnings

**Average brain changes between 73 and 76**

- Grey matter volume: -.07 SDs/year
- Normal-appearing white matter volume: -.10 SDs/year
- White matter hyperintensity volume: +.11 SDs/year
- General fractional anisotropy: -.09 SDs/year
- General mean diffusivity: +.34 SDs/year

## Coupled brain/cognitive changes - summary

- Volume declines across the lifespan
- Of volumetric results, best cognitive predictor/coupling is often white matter hyperintensities (pathology)
- White matter microstructure changes alongside fluid intelligence
- Some unexpected results (no coupled change between white matter and processing speed)
  - Larger studies required

## Next steps

- Increase power

  - Larger, longer studies with additional waves?

- Get specific

  - Brain networks rather than broad measures?

  - Spatial interaction of hyperintensities and healthy white matter?

- Find predictors

  - Early-life rather than old-age?

- Add genetics

  - Polygenic scores to predict brain or cognitive changes?
