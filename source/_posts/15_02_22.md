# Cognitive and neural effects of drugs of abuse

## Concept of Drug dependence

![Concept of Drug Dependence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202203171841445.png)PFC (prefrontal cortex) is the "executive centre" for planning and decision making. 

![PFC integrates glutamate and dopamine inputs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202203171840809.png)

It involves **attention **salient information and **working memory**; PFC integrates **glutamate** and **dopamine** inputs

### 5-CSRTT

The **Five-choice serial-reaction time task** is a laboratory behavioural task used in psychological research to assess visuospatial attention and motor impulsivity in animals

The 5CSRTT requires the animal to correctly identify which of the five apertures has been briefly illuminated, via a nose poke, in order to receive a sugar reward

Assesses **sustained** attention, **divided** attention and **selective** attention.

### Animal models of Impulsive behaviour (ADHD)

1. Stop-Signal Reaction Time Task
2. Five-Choice Serial Reaction Time Task
3. Delay-Discounting Paradigm: Delay discounting refers to the tendency for individuals to prefer immediate rewards over rewards received after a delay, even if the magnitude of the delayed reward is larger (Kirby et al., 1999; Berns et al., 2007) 延迟满足

There are similarities between patients with ventromedial prefrontal/orbitofrontal cortex (VMPC) damage and drug addicts.

### Tools to assess decision

Iowa gambling task

## Summary

1. Acute administration of stimulants can enhance performance - may be one of the reasons for self-administering the drug – ‘functional reinforcement’.
2. The acute withdrawal from these abused substances can transiently disrupt cognitive control functions such as attentional selection.
3. These observations of impaired performance have been observed in subjects dependent on nicotine, cocaine and heroin.

# Vocabularies

**exacerbate**: make (a problem, bad situation, or negative feeling) worse.

**ensue**: to happen after something else, especially as a result of it.

**deleterious**: harmful

**PFC**: Prefrontal cortex, executive centre’ for planning and decision making

**withdrawal symptoms:** 戒断反应

**consensus:** a generally accepted opinion or decision among a group of people

**VMPC:** ventromedial prefrontal/orbitofrontal cortex
