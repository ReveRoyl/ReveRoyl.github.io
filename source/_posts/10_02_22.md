### Experimental design

1. #### categorical design

   distinct types of stimuli or the timing, participant instructions

2. #### factorial design

   usually 2 pairs of controlled factors

3. #### parametric design

   modify the control variables

   
### Timing of stimuli

1. #### block design

   Block some variables

   ##### pros

   most commonly used

   statistically the most powerful

   ##### cons

   can be **predicable**, lead to rapid habituation or anticipation (reduced response)

   **cannot** **extract** specific stimulus brain response

   some design **cannot** be modelled as a **block**

   can be affected by cumulative effects (context)

2. #### event-related design

   Each stimulus is individual epoch (can be associated with discrete events)

   ##### pros

   parallel behavioural studies

   greater flexibility (more complex)

   ##### cons

   related designs require a greater understanding of fMRI because the design (more complex)

   less statistical power (can be reduced to extend the scanning time)

3. mixed design

   mix the two above design together

### Spatial Normalization

transform a brain image into a standard brain coordinate system 

**SPM** (Statistical Parametric Mapping) spatial normalisation

### Segmentation

We do not use intensity threshold to segment for the following reasons:

User intervention to decide what lever to threshold

Bias field correction (an MRI artefact which causes slow changes in image intensity across the brain)

Image noise (random regions of white matter have low levels of intensity which may be classified as grey matter)

Modulation can increase the contrast ratio (an analogy: just like the reverse of using a rolling pin on pastry)

### Smoothing

Take into account variations in structural anatomy

To reduce noise

To increase the normality of the data

Smoothing amount is measured as FWHM (A common smoothing kernel for VBM is 8-12mm)
