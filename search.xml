After several trails, here is the stable version.</p><h2 id="Version-control"><a href="#Version-control" class="headerlink" title="Version control"></a>Version control</h2><p>Here is a useful distributed revision control tool: Git</p><p><a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://git-scm.com/download/win</a></p><p>For the last install step, choose <code>Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt</code></p><h2 id="New-a-repository"><a href="#New-a-repository" class="headerlink" title="New a repository"></a>New a repository</h2><p>New a initialized (with readme.md) repository in your Github library.</p><h2 id="Install-Hexo"><a href="#Install-Hexo" class="headerlink" title="Install Hexo"></a>Install Hexo</h2><p>Create a new folder in a suitable place to store your own blog files. For example, my blog files are stored in<code>D:\blog</code>。</p><p>Right click in this directory <code>Git Bash Here</code>，Open the console window of git, all our later operations will be performed in the git console。</p><p>Find this directory and enter <code>npm i hexo-cli -g</code></p><p>You can type down<code>hexo -v</code> to verify if the installation was successful.</p><p>Then we need to initialize our website, type down<code>hexo init</code>to initialize the folder, and then type down<code>npm install</code> to install the necessary components.</p><p>Until now, the local website configuration is also done.</p><p>Type down <code>hexo g</code> to generate a static webpage, then type down <code>hexo s</code> to open the local server.</p><p>Finally open the browser [<a href="http://localhost:4000/]" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://localhost:4000/]</a>(<a href="https://link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://link</a>. zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//localhost%3A4000/), you can see your blog</p><p>You can press ctrl+c to shut down the local server.</p><h2 id="Connect-Github-with-local"><a href="#Connect-Github-with-local" class="headerlink" title="Connect Github with local"></a>Connect Github with local</h2><p>This is a important step which can help you deploy your blog to the cloud (I got stuck in this step for a while night).</p><p>First right-click to open git bash, and then enter the following command:</p><p><code>git config --global user.name &quot;{yourusername}&quot;git config --global user.email &quot;{youremailaddress}&quot;</code></p><p>The username and email address should be modified according to the information you registered with github.</p><p>Then generate the key SSH key:</p><p><code>ssh-keygen -t rsa -C &quot;{youremailaddress}&quot;</code></p><p>Open github, click settings under the avatar, then click SSH and GPG keys to create a new SSH with any name.</p><p>Enter in git bash<code>cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code>. Copy the output to the box and click OK to save.</p><p>Enter <code>ssh -T git@github.com</code>, if your username appears as shown in the figure below, congratulations, you succeed.</p><p>Open the _config.yml file in the root directory of the blog, which is the configuration file of the blog, where you can modify various information related to the blog.</p><p>Modify the configuration on the last line:</p><pre class="line-numbers language-bash"><code class="language-bash">deploy:  type: <span class="token function">git</span>  repository: https://github.com/<span class="token punctuation">{</span>yourusername<span class="token punctuation">}</span>/<span class="token punctuation">{</span>yourusername<span class="token punctuation">}</span>.github.io.git  branch: master<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre><p><strong>Tips:</strong> Remember to set the branch master as default or you can change the master into main in above code. Because the rule is changed after Nov, 2020: the master branch has been changed into main.  It may be used to avoid the term: “master slave”.</p><h2 id="write-articles-publish-articles"><a href="#write-articles-publish-articles" class="headerlink" title="write articles, publish articles"></a>write articles, publish articles</h2><p>First, right-click in the blog root directory to open git bash and install an extension </p><p><code>npm i hexo-deployer-git</code></p><p>Then enter <code>hexo new post &quot;article title&quot;</code> to create a new article.</p><p>Then open the <code>D:\blog\source\_posts</code> directory, you can find that there is an additional folder and a .md file below, one is used to store your pictures and other data, and the other is your article file.</p><p>After writing the markdown file, enter <code>hexo g</code> in the root directory to generate a static web page, then enter <code>hexo s</code> to preview the effect locally, and finally enter <code>hexo d</code> to upload it to Github. </p><p>You can see the published article in the <strong>github.io</strong> now!

In this study, the longitudinal associations between children and parents are verified to serve as a potential social buffer to adolescent behavioral and neurobiological regulation and ameliorate false alarms and brain activation toward affective cues.</p><p>51 adolescents with ages ranging between 31 and 35 months were classified into secure group and insecure group by a modified 17-minute Strange Situation procedure. We then analyzed the data of behaviour and fMRI from those adolescents when they were completing social go-nogo tasks, compared the conditions of presence of their parents and the adolescents alone without parents.</p><p>In false alarm test, appetitive group shows significant difference between secure and insecure. Aversive model indicates that secure adolescents alone have better behavioral regulation and with parental presence there are promotion in insecure adolescents’ regulation. </p><p>Findings show the presence of a parent promote regulation for insecure adolescents in aversive social contexts. Further supported by the reduction of hyperactivity in brain regions associated with socioemotional processing in the presence of a parent. </p>]]></content>

Explain, using equations, the phenomenon of ‘Blocking’."></a>The so-called ‘delta rule’ has been used to describe learning based on predicted reward. Explain, using equations, the phenomenon of ‘Blocking’.</h1><p>Blocking is the phenomenon where there will be no association with the new stimulus is formed when the unconditional reflex has been predicted. It generally refers to the inability to express knowledge or skills due to failures in learning or memory. If the unconditional stimulus is already predicted fully by one stimulus, and the addition of a new stimulus does not provide any new important information about the unconditional stimuli, the unconditional stimuli will not activate or support the learning process which is responsible for establishing the new conditional reflex. Explaining the phenomenon of blocking in detail, here first come the delta law and reinforcement learning model:</p><p>The delta law model is a learning model that describes changes in the strength of synapse, such as learning the relationship between stimulus and reward, using gradient descent to find the optimal weight vector. The gradient descent method is to solve the minimum value of the function, i.e., the error, along the direction of gradient descent.</p><p>Classical conditioning is a basic form of associative learning which is considered an essential component of complex learning. Typically, classical conditioning occurs when a neutral stimulus (conditional stimulus) is paired closely or consecutively temporally with a biological stimulus (unconditional stimulus) eliciting a reflex behaviour that is still unlearned (unconditional response).</p><p>Here is a simple stimuli- reward model:</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202201221004405.png" alt="img"></p><p>In this equation, the w is the weight ratio which is learned with the delta rule from the association of stimulus and reward. It is a vector, which means that its direction can be changed as the stimulus changes. This directionality is necessary for the presence of multiple stimuli. The u is the presence or absence of a stimulus, which takes a binary value between 0 and 1, that is, u is 1 if there is a stimulus, and u is 0 if there is no stimulus.</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202201221005012.png" alt="img"></p><p>Here δ is the predictive error for a given stimulus and reward, which can be predicted by the following equation:</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202201221005829.png" alt="img"></p><p>Here the ε defines a learning rate, i.e., how fast shall we update the association between the stimulus and reward, this value is between 0 and 1. If ε is 0, it means there is no learning, thus this stimulus-reward association model is locked, and the association between stimulus and reward is not updated with any subsequent learning. If ε = 1 means that the association between stimulus and reward will change completely after one learning, this learning model is also generally meaningless for prediction. Usually, this learning rate is individually dependent and different in various conditions. Through this equation, we can predict the efficiency of learning. Another problem is that the external noise will interfere with the forecast. For the external noise error, we can introduce a filter coefficient and a series of convolution operations to eliminate it. </p><p>A simple learning equation based on unconditional reflexes can explain the phenomenon of the blocking well:</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202201221004196.png" alt="img"></p><p>Here ε still represents the learning rate. The λ is the maximum binding strength for a given unconditional stimuli. The σv is the sum of the strengths of associations between all conditional and unconditional stimuli. The δv is the change in binding strength of a particular conditional reflex on various trials. According to this equation, the blocking occurs when λ equals σv, i.e., the binding strength obtained by the conditional stimulus paired with the unconditional stimulus reaches the λ value. There are two groups in one experiment to test it. First, a conditional stimulus is paired with an unconditional stimulus. The second conditional stimulus then undergoes compound conditioning with the first and the same unconditional stimulus. If it is in the absence of blocking, the second combination has little regulation. However, if the combination of the first group is not or weakly regulated, there will be a large amount of associative strength the second combination as well as the first combination in the second group. Blocking occurs because the second stimulus loses relevance. In this equation, blocking will result in an ignorance of new information, which means “stop learning”.</p><p>All in all, blocking, in a simple word, is an expression of the learning failure or a classical conditional response. The blocking may play an important role in how animals process information in their environment. Because animals are constantly exposed to numerous stimuli, in which case, selectively responding to those stimuli may keep us away from “brain crashes” caused by too much information. Sometimes, ignorance is a blessing.</p>]]></content>

      <title>Nature of dopamine dysfunction in schizophrenia</title>

A microdialysis probe is surgically inserted into the brain region that we want to study. The front end of the probe is covered by a semipermeable fibre membrane, and the two ends are connected to the inlet and outlet tubes of artificial cerebrospinal fluid. The dopamine in human brain passively diffuses across the semipermeable membrane into the artificial cerebrospinal fluid by the exchange of substances in artificial cerebrospinal fluid and in the cerebrospinal fluid. This is a sensitive method, however, unfortunately, it has a low temporal resolution.</p></li><li><p>Electrochemical method. The first step, the same as the method mentioned above, is to undergo surgery to implant deep-brain stimulation electrodes. The carbon fibre electrodes are placed near the surface of the cells to be recorded, and a certain voltage is applied to the electrodes, which is kept higher than the redox potential of the neurotransmitters to be detected. The fast scan cyclic voltammetry is used with the electrodes to collect the electrical signals for relevant fast dopamine pulse and obtains results after a series of processes and analyses. This method results in a specific detection at the cellular level. However, although the fast-scan cyclic voltammetry has high temporal resolution and certain specificity of neurotransmitter molecules, it is difficult to achieve simultaneous detection of multiple regions.</p></li><li><p>Molecular imaging, a non-invasive methodology. One important method is positron emission tomography, PET. In this molecular imaging method, a radiolabelled ligand is administered intravenously. Afterwards, the patients are placed in a PET camera, and the data is collected every few seconds while the volunteers perform tasks in the scanner. If the neurotransmitter is released during the scan, the concentration of ligand in the receptor will decrease as it is replaced by the endogenously released neurotransmitter. The dopamine synthesis and the concentration of transporters, which are positively correlated with dopamine cells, can be measured in this way. The test involves injecting a radioactive substance that binds to a dopamine transporter, which can be measured using the camera. </p></li></ol><p>However, the researchers may be more interested in the interpretation of the nature of dopamine dysfunction in schizophrenia by these measurements than by the methods.</p><p>In previous studies, both striatal dopamine synthesis capacity and release are found to be elevated in patients with schizophrenia. Clinically, schizophrenia is generally classified as a dopaminergic sub-type and a non-dopaminergic sub-type. For antipsychotic responders, the measure for dopamine via the measure for the dopamine-related enzyme is shown to have a higher level, while indirectly demonstrating psychosis patients have higher dopamine synthesis capacity and the disease is responsive to subsequent antipsychotic treatment. The level of dopamine synthesis and secretion is related to the treatment of schizophrenia. With Voxel-wise analysis, The research of Jauhar et. al demonstrate that the lack of dopamine synthesis is consistent with whether patients respond to the treatments in the clinic has consistency with dopamine dysfunction. For the patients who responded to treatment, there is an increase in dopamine synthesis capacity relative to non-responder. Patients who responded to treatment had increased dopamine synthesis capacity compared with healthy individuals. The classic dopamine hypothesis states that the dopamine dysfunction in the prefrontal cortex leads to negative symptoms in schizophrenia, while dopamine hyperfunction in the mesolimbic pathway leads to positive symptoms. The measurement of dopamine in neuroimaging informs us about the phenomenon of dopamine dysfunction in schizophrenia. And combining with the basis that dopamine signalling is involved in labelling environmental spurs, we can predict that dopamine dysfunction in striatal regions is the main cause of schizophrenia which may lead to functional impairment of striatal regions,</p><p>However, our detection techniques for the brain are still not accurate enough, such as we cannot accurately detect receptor and synaptic dopamine levels in vivo. Based on the current level of science and technology, we cannot fully understand the role of the dopamine system in the start and development of schizophrenia. Nevertheless, the dopamine hypothesis is still powerful and relevant. With the continuous increase of human understanding of the brain, targeting this system, the development of new treatments still has great potential and prospects.</p>]]></content>

The use of animal models is an extremely important experimental approach in modern biological research, which contributes to a more convenient and effective understanding of human brain connectivity research. Much of our knowledge about advanced cognitive functions and complex behaviours come from the use of animal models. Research on the structural connectivity of the human brain could lead to a new understanding of the connectome.</p><p>Network analysis of animal brains can bring us closer to the reality of how the human brain really works. Undoubtedly, animal models are of great help to the study of human brain structural connectivity, and they greatly facilitate such studies. First, the risks associated with direct experiments on humans are avoided in this way. For example, Brenner et. al construct a model of Caenorhabditis elegans and Larry et. al found a model of mice. Second, some commonly seen diseases in clinics that we want to study with the connectome can be replicated with animal models at any time. Moreover, this type of research can overcome the shortcomings of long incubation periods, duration and low morbidity. The experimental conditions can be strictly controlled to enhance the comparability of experimental materials. Finally, it also helps to understand the essence of the human brain. If only through clinical research, its performance may have its own characteristics. Through the comparative study of the map of neural connections between humans and animals, we can understand the various effects of the same condition on different organisms. Therefore, in a sense, the research work can be sublimated to a three-dimensional level to reveal the essence of certain connectivity, which is more conducive to explaining all the changes that have occurred in the human body. The use of animal models also allows us to observe the impact of environmental or genetic factors on the development in detail, which is impossible in clinical practice.</p><p>One example is that using animal models, the animal brain is serially sliced into many slices, each slice is imaged at high resolution with an electron microscope, and each neuron&#39;s branches and synaptic connections to other neurons are traced. Meanwhile, research on human brain structural connectivity can be classified into the connectomics discipline, deciphering vast neural systems with automatization and computer-assisted collaboration.</p><p>In this case, what is the significance of a large-scale animal model for whole-brain structural connectivity to address closer to our own nervous system?</p><p>The emergence of large-scale connectomic data in animal models, including complete reconstructions of neurons in the adult central brain, has great importance. Comparing non-invasive connectome maps of the same animal model brain will enhance our understanding of the structural basis of signals measured by current non-invasive techniques widely used in the human brain.</p><p>The mouse is an excellent animal model for studying brain connectivity, as there are many mouse models involving a variety of brain diseases, well-established experimental methods and theories. Mammalian brains all contain lots of the same cortical and subcortical regions, interregional projections, and intraregional connectivity. The mice have many organizational features that are also present in the human nervous system. Importantly, once the connectomic infrastructure at the scale required to connect the entire mouse brain is established, it will also be useful in animal models of diseases. Many other connectomic studies will be possible.</p><p>However, the use of animal models in the study of human brain structural connectivity is not perfect. First and foremost, the advanced level of animal evolution does not mean that all organs and functions are close to the human level. The unique structure and function are difficult to reproduce in animal models, so blindly using animal models to explain the mechanism of the human brain will undoubtedly be far from the truth. Moreover, with the development of big data science, the demand for non-biological thinking systems for the study of human brain structural connectivity is increasing day by day. In some way, those models can explain mechanisms better.</p><p>However, everything has its pros and cons. For the application of human brain connectivity research in big data science, the revelation of animal models to its engineering and computers is of great significance. For sure living animals have higher learning intelligence than computer programs. In terms of cognitive learning, animal models are more effective. One example is that inductive learning can be performed through a small number of samples, which AI systems cannot yet have. Besides, our research using mammalian brains is more resource efficient.</p><p>Due to the limitations of technology, it is still difficult for us to understand the connected group, and it is largely unexplainable. The connectome will generate entirely unexpected questions about the nervous system and may allow us to understand the principles.</p>]]></content>

As early as 1949, Hebb proposed that learning and memory are stored as changes in the strength of synaptic connections between neurons. Along with the discovery of the LTP phenomenon by Bliss &amp; Lomo (1973) and subsequent research, the hypothesis that the LTP provides a neural basis for learning and memory formation has been widely accepted by the public. The NMDAR-dependent LTP processes in the hippocampus, especially in the CA1 subregion of the hippocampus, are thought to be the neural basis for spatial learning and memory (Martin et al., 2000, Bliss &amp; Collingridge, 1993). The hippocampus consists of four Cornu Ammonis regions (CA1 to CA4) and dentate gyrus (DG), of which CA4 can also be considered part of the DG due to the partial overlap of structure and function (Andersen et al., 2007, Anand &amp; Dhikav, 2012). With the desire of studying hippocampal subregions, one question is proposed: how can we specifically study the subregions? The arrangement of hippocampal neurons allows the hippocampus to be sliced, leaving most of the relevant circuitry intact (Purves, Augustine &amp; Fitzpatrick, 2001). The undamaged circuit of the individual subregions ensures the feasibility and authenticity of our study about each subregion. Thus, in-depth study of each subregion has become a hot topic in the past decades. This essay aims to discuss NMDAR-dependent LTP in different hippocampal subregions can have distinct and similar roles in learning and memory.</p><p>LTP can be observed at three main excitatory synapses in the hippocampal circuit, the excitatory synaptic pathway of the hippocampus. In this circuit, the perforant pathway extends from pyramidal cells in the entorhinal area to granule cells in the DG; the mossy fibre pathway extends from granule cells in the DG to CA3 pyramidal cells; Schaffer collateral pathways from CA3 pyramidal cells to CA1 pyramidal cells (Fig 1). Bliss &amp; Collingridge (1993), Nicoll &amp; Malenka (1995) believe that two subregions, CA1 and DG, show NMDAR-dependent LTP. However, their findings do not imply the absence of NMDA receptor-dependent LTP in other hippocampal subregions due to the limitations in-vitro experiments. In 2002, Lee &amp; Kesner collected some data indicating the involvement of NMDAR in CA3, which may be explained as an attractor state (a temporarily self-sustaining state), with a computational model based on physiological evidence and behavioural experiments. In this research, Lee suggested behavioural evidence for differences in NMDAR spatial working memory function among hippocampal subregions. Lee&#39;s research eliminates the influence of another type of LTP with the local subregion-specific injection of NMDAR antagonists. As the participation of CA3, the role of the hippocampal NMDAR-dependent LTP might be misunderstood. However, previous research still cannot explain the role in the hippocampal subregions well. The association hypothesis between NMDAR-dependent LTP and learning and memory in hippocampal subregions require more experiments to validate. When we focus on each subregion, their distinct and similar roles in learning and memory may be revealed.</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202202161917751.png" alt="image-20220216191746673"></p><p><strong>Figure 1</strong>. LTP in Schaffer collateral pathway, mossy fibre pathway and perforant pathway (Chen et al. 1997)</p><p>The CA1 subregion is the neural foundation linking spatial learning and memory. Tsien et. al (1996a, 1996b) knockout the GluN1 subunit (in NMDAR) resulting in the deficit of LTP in Schaffer collateral CA1 synapses finding the spatial reference memory is impaired in mice. This research directly proves that NMDAR-dependent LTP at CA1 synapses is the neural foundation for associative, long-term spatial memory formation. Additionally, CA1-KO mice lack NMDAR-mediated postsynaptic currents and LTP in CA1. These mice showed impaired spatial memory in the Morris hidden platform water maze, in the opposite, performed well on non-spatial learning tasks. The results provide contrastive support for the hypothesis that NMDAR-mediated LTP in the CA1 region is critical for the formation of some specific types of memory. Similarly, spatial learning deficits were reported in mice with the impaired LTP in CA1 owing to the lack of the gene encoding α subunit of calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (αCaMKII) (Silva et al., 1992a, 1992b). These mice lack spatial memory, the same as spatial memory deficits in CA1-KO mice. A possible shortcoming in this experiment is that previous experiments are based on direct injection of NMDAR antagonists into the brain, which may not be sufficiently convincing in terms of regional idiosyncrasy. According to Hestrin&#39;s discovery in 1996: NMDAR contributes to synaptic transmission in some regions of the neocortex. We can conclude that memory impairment can be explained, at least in part, by deficits in the computing ability of the neocortex, rather than impairments in synaptic plasticity within the hippocampus. Subsequently, Bannerman et al. (2012) used transgenic mice lacking the GluN1 subunit and NMDARs in the pyramidal cells of CA1 and the granule cells of DG finding that the spatial reference memory of the mice acquired the radial maze task was impaired. It furtherly demonstrates the fact: hippocampal CA1 plays an important role in the learning of spatial reference memory. In 2013, it took a turn when Taylor et al. found that such mice performed well on the classic open-field spatial reference memory water maze task. How can it happen? It possibly indicates that the hippocampal NMDAR is not actually required for the formation of long-term associative spatial memory, which is against Tsien&#39;s results. But Taylor does not explain this in detail, thus it cannot determine whether there are any other compensatory mechanisms for NMDA-dependent LTP. Whatever, as Niewoehner et al. (2007) argues, the development of spatially restricted genetic modifications has identified synaptic plasticity, which is a broader idea than LTP, with specific and separable roles in different hippocampal subregions. We may want to see more genetic modification experiments in this field. Despite the shortcomings of these research, the inter-experimental corroboration still demonstrates that CA1 has an irreplaceable role in associative, long-term spatial memory. We can consider CA1 LTP to be the basis of spatial memory formation.</p><p>In the CA2 subregion, NMDA-dependent LTP cannot be induced. Zhao et al. (2007) attempted to test whether synaptic stimulation could induce LTP in CA2 neurons, which is proved to induce NMDAR-dependent LTP in CA1, using a variety of approaches including perforated whole-cell patch-clamp recording. However, all results lead to that the synaptic current is not increased. One of the explanations from Caruana, Alexander, &amp; Dudek (2012) is that the high expression of TREK-1 and TREK-2 potassium channels in CA2, compared with other hippocampal subregions, leads to the lack of LTP. These channels produce potassium-mediated leakage currents significantly hyperpolarizing the resting membrane potential. Thus, larger depolarizing currents are required to initiate LTP. Therefore, is it necessary to look for the memory learning function of LTP in CA2? Zhao compared the expression patterns of NMDAR mRNAs in CA2 and CA3 finding that those mRNAs are expressed in both subregions. What distinguish the CA2 and the CA3? Certain &quot;memory suppressor&quot; genes (e.g., RGS14) play a key role in suppressing LTP induction (Lee et al., 2010a, 2010b, Dudek et al., 2016). More evidence suggests that the induction of NMDAR-dependent LTP and memory formation in CA2 can occur under very specific conditions (Wersinger et al., 2002, Prediger &amp; Takahashi, 2005, DeVito et al., 2009, Caruana et al., 2012). We conclude that NMDAR-dependent LTP in the CA2 area is rare, but not impossible. Therefore, its role in CA2 needs further study.</p><p>The NMDAR-dependent LTP in CA3 is involved in learning and memory storage acquisition although NMDAR-dependent LTP in CA3 is uncommon. The fact that LTP in the Moss fiber-CA3 system coincides with the progress in learning demonstrates the role of CA3 in learning and memory. Based on electrophysiological data by Martinez et al. (2002), an associative LTP was found in the perforant pathway inputting into CA3, which means that there is NMDAR-dependent LTP between perforant pathway and the CA3 synapse. The following step is to study its function. Nakazawa et al. (2003) found that &quot;one-time learning&quot; is blocked by specific knockout of CA3 NMDAR in mice. We thus argue that NMDA-dependent LTP in CA3 plays an important role in the information acquiring and storing from new experiences. Lee &amp; Kesner&#39;s (2004) study also demonstrated that CA3 neurons are activated during recall of objects or locations. It refers that NMDA-dependent LTP in CA3 may affect object-location pairing association tasks. In hippocampal CA3, two distinct forms of LTP have been described, one of which is the classical NMDA-dependent LTP (Zalutsky and Nicoll, 1990). The disadvantage of these experiments is that we do not know whether to confirm the function of another LTP and whether it is also involved in memory and learning functions. Although these experiments do not cover all types of LTPs, at least we know that NMDAR-dependent LTP in CA3 is involved in memory acquisition.</p><p>The NMDAR-dependent LTP in DG focuses more on spatial working memory (SWM) (Active spatial information in working memory over a short period (van Asselen et al., 2006)) than spatial reference memory (SRM). Nosten-Bertrand et al. (1996) first proposed that spatial learning is not obviously blocked in the absence of a DG LTP gene anaesthetized rats, which we mentioned present in CA1. Although a subsequent study by Errington et al. (1997) speculated that this phenomenon may be due to the effect of gene knockout on inhibitory neurons. Additional evidence for this hypothesis is that massive loss of the NR1 subunit of the NMDAR only showed severely impaired LTP in the perforant pathway inputs of the DG, whereas LTP is unchanged from CA3 to CA1. Based on this study, behavioural assessments of these mice show significant SWM impairment but no effect on hippocampal-dependent SRM performance for the same task. However, other studies have demonstrated that DG selectivity, fibre-sparing, and colchicine lesions can lead to impairment of both SWM and SRM (Xavier, Oliveira-Filho &amp; Santos, 1999). This is complemented with behavioural experiments by Jeltsch et al. (2001), where DG impairment significantly increases SRM and SWM errors in the four-from-eight radial maze task. The downside, however, is that these results fail to provide positive evidence for the hypothesis that NMDAR-mediated synaptic plasticity in the DG supports spatial pattern separation. The present results cannot completely rule out a role for the NMDAR LTP in the DG in spatial pattern separation across tasks, although it is clearly shown that any putative role must be limited to the working memory. We can argue that DG may be involved in both spatial working memory and SRM but is more focused on spatial working memory.</p><p>The biggest difference among the function of NMDAR-dependent LTP hippocampal subregions is the roles these played in spatial learning. According to earlier studies, in contrast to CA1, damages to mossy fibre to CA3 LTP (Huang et al., 1995) and perforant pathway to DG LTP (Nosten-Bertrand et al., 1996) are not associated with deficits in spatial memory. Huang et al. (1999) found that mossy fibre CA3 LTP and perforant DG LTP are dispensable for spatial learning. This is consistent with the notion that CA1 LTP is critical for spatial learning. CA1 LTPs are particularly important for spatial and contextual learning in the hippocampus compared to CA3 or DG LTPs. What is more, subsequent further studies confirmed that other subregions are also involved in learning and memory. Okada et al. (2003) examined the effect of NMDA-dependent LTP on spatial learning in rats after increasing the extent of NMDA-dependent LTP by using viral vectors for gene editing. It is demonstrated that although CA1 and the DG have similar mechanisms of LTP induction, they play distinct functional roles in spatial learning. To explore the differences in information storage capacity, Bromer et al. (2018) used a method combining signal detection theory with accurate 3D reconstruction of serial section electron microscopy to study in vivo perforant pathway LTP processes in the DG of the mature hippocampus. Bromer et al. investigate synaptic plasticity and information storage capacity. It is found that the information storage capacity of the DG is much lower than CA1. This study elucidates the temporal LTP process of storing information and the inter-regional variation of information storage capacity, that is, differences in spatial learning between CA1 and DG.</p><p>This essay focuses on the roles of NMDAR-dependent LTP in learning and memory in various hippocampal subregions. From these studies, we can conclude that the NMDA-dependent LTP in CA1 and the DG gets involved in acquiring memory that needs to be retrieved after a delay period beyond the short-term. CA1 is the basis of spatial memory formation, associating spatial learning and memory. DG also plays an important role in spatial working memory, mainly in spatial working memory. The NMDAR-dependent LTP in CA3 is significant in situations where reorganization of spatial representations memory is required. It is involved in memory acquisition as well, with a focus on spatial reference memory. The recognition of each subregion can help us understand the integral mechanism. We should consider each subregion separately but focus on the overall functional interaction. It may become an innovative point for future research. Although many computational models and anatomical studies have highlighted functional differences between NMDAR-dependent LTP in the hippocampus, the subregional heterogeneity of NMDAR function is still largely unknown. Therefore, as the technology develops, the following research on the mechanisms of NMDA-dependent LTP in each subregion and interaction are supposed to be further explored.</p><h2 id="Reference"><a href="#Reference" class="headerlink" title="Reference"></a><strong>Reference</strong></h2><ol><li><p>Hebb, D.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a comparison and contrast between two common proteinopathies (Alzheimer’s disease &amp; Parkinson’s disease), discussing clinical symptoms, epidimiology and pathological hallmarks.</p><h1 id="Main-body"><a href="#Main-body" class="headerlink" title="Main body"></a>Main body</h1><p>The present view takes proteinopathy as an umbrella term for the neurodegenerative disorders caused by the accumulation of misfolded protein, which is attributable to the conformational error of the protein (Bayer, 2015, Lanuti, 2020) These aggregated proteins were verified to gain typical amyloid features (Virchow, 1854) which means the “starch” conformation. In this case, these proteins might not only lose their original normal function but also gain toxicity (Luheshi et al., 2008). Speaking of proteinopathies, two diseases must be mentioned: One is Parkinson’s disease (PD), the most famous progressive neurodegenerative diseases associated with motor as well as nonmotor deficits, which is known as the second common neurodegenerative disorder, (Capriotti &amp; Terzakis, 2016; Simon et al., 2020; Hayes, 2019); the other one is Alzheimer’s disease (AD), one of the most major reason for dementia, the most common neurodegenerative disorder (Lane, Hardy &amp; Schott, 2018). There are around one billion sufferers around the world who are suffering both physical and psychological agony from these neurodegenerative disorders in 2019 (Bulck et al., 2019). Various factors, for instance genomic, epigenomic, metabolic, or environmental factors (Bulck et al., 2019), are shown to have an impact on PD and AD in a permutation and combination way. Here this essay will go into detail about these two common proteinopathies in three aspects: clinical symptoms, epidemiology and pathological hallmarks.</p><p>In terms of clinical symptoms between PD and AD, multiple similar as well as differing pathological phenotypes can be identified, which is treated under the comparison and contrast between PD and AD (Table 1). PD and AD are both irreversible progressive, degenerative diseases meaning the symptoms will gradually become more severe as the stages develop. The most obvious problems about patients’ cognitive and psychiatric symptoms come first as we consider these neurodegenerative diseases. As far as we know, AD is well-known for its influence on memory, academically called amnesia which was first conceptualized as memory loss in 1763 by Sauvagues (Langer, 2019). Most of the advanced AD sufferers are reported to have Amnesia symptoms, accounting for fifty per cent to seventy per cent of all patients with dementia (Burns &amp; Iliffe 2009), while it seldomly happens to PD patients. Only the most severe PD sufferers are reported to experience similar amnesia symptoms (Querfurth &amp; LaFerla, 2010). At the memory level, patients with AD not only have amnesia but also often experience memory distortions (El Haj et al. 2020, Younan et al., 2020), such as having comprehensive and vivid memories of episodic occurrences that have never been observed. AD symptoms are generally considered as an essential impairment of episodic memory (Younan et al., 2020), while one’s attention is compromised on AD’s early stage as well, especially in those with early age onset and atypical syndromes (Malhotra, 2018). One feature of AD is that the symptoms are accompanied by severe attentional impairment frequently which is linked with other neurodegenerative disorders as well (Malhotra, 2018). It is suggested that PD patients suffer more depression and anxiety (Sveinbjornsdottir, 2016) than AD patients, which may be concluded to the inconsistency between one’s movements and willingness.</p><p>Apart from memory problems for AD and PD, some other motor symptoms can also put huge inconvenience to one’s life. PD patients are reported to have three main symptoms which are tremor, bradykinesia and rigidity (Hayes, 2019). Tremor means shaking, especially after a short pause of a postural movement. Bradykinesia implies a slower movement than normal action which may cause difficulties for some ordinary tasks like walking or doing dishes. Rigidity or spasticity refers to muscle stiffness, which is academically called dystonia (Tolosa &amp; Compta, 2006). Unlike those symptoms in AD, these three main symptoms in PD are more relying on the neuromuscular connection so that these are all related to muscle control abnormality which is the direct result of neurodegeneration the same as AD (McGregor &amp; Nelson, 2019). Similarly, AD patients also suffer motor problems like dysphagia referring to the difficulty in swallowing, which is also reported in eleven to eighty-one per cent of PD patients (Takizawa et al., 2016). Patients with AD gradually lose cognitive functions until they reach the final stage of the disease, which is characterised by full failure of control over body functions (Boccardi et al., 2016).</p><p>Regarding the nonmotor symptoms, anosmia (the sense loss of smell) and ageusia (the sense loss of taste), are common in PD. And the equivalent olfactory loss is also observed in AD (Doty 2012), which may be contributed to the shared pathological features. It may be corroborated that the olfactory loss is significantly linked to cognitive level (Tarakad &amp; Jankovic, 2017). This is different from PD: AD patients show more cognitive impairments. There occur some other cognitive problems in AD more than memory. For example, one type of language disorder, aphasia is usually related to AD owing to the damage of frontal, temporal, or parietal language cortices. And these aphasias caused by AD accounts for nearly thirty per cent of primary degenerative aphasias (Teichmann &amp; Ferrieux, 2013). The problems are not only about daily life activity but also about the biological clock. Sleep disturbances and sleep disorders come to be big problems for AD and PD patients since these are long term and progressive diseases. (Peter-Derex, 2015). Sleep disorders, on the other hand, is reported to be linked to an increased risk of AD. Both situations have a negative impact on one’s attention (Hennawy et al., 2019). Insomnia and exhaustion are also the following side effects of sleep disorders. Together with physical discomfort, those symptoms above can cause psychological discomfort in PD when comparing PD and AD. Neuralgia has become a severe problem for patients. There are five main forms of pain are documented in PD sufferers which are separately dystonia, musculoskeletal pain, nerve or nerve root pain, primary or central pain and akathisia with some samples (Rana 2013). </p><p>To sum up, AD and PD symptoms are generally different, but these share some key features at the same time. PD patients are more likely to have primarily motor abnormalities, whereas AD patients normally experience dementia and cognitive impairment (Meireles &amp; Massano 2012). The neuronal death is a typical feature of both illnesses, the autopsy histopathology of the brains from AD and PD patients are distinct in each instance and diverse from one another (Ganguly et al., 2017). AD focuses more on cognitive symptoms while PD focus more on physical symptoms even though these can be divided into motor and nonmotor symptoms.</p><p><strong>Table 1.</strong> Comparison and contrast table of Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease in symptoms, causes, onset age, treatment, and lifespan expectancy.</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>AD</th><th>PD</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Clinical symptoms</td><td>Amnesia (El Haj et  al., 2020)  Impairments of  attention (Malhotra, 2018)  Disorder of episodic  memory (Younan et al., 2020)  Memory distortions (El  Haj et al. 2020)  Dysphagia (Boccardi et  al., 2016)  Dysphasia (Teichmann  &amp; Ferrieux, 2013)  Sleep disruption and  sleep disorders (Hennawy et al., 2019)</td><td>Tremor  Bradykinesia  Rigidity (NHS, 2019)  Loss of balance  Anosmia and ageusia  (Doty, 2012; Tarakad &amp; Jankovic, 2017)  Neuralgia (Rana et  al., 2013)  Urinary infection (Gerlach,  Winogrodzka &amp; Weber 2011)  Depression, anxiety  (Sveinbjornsdottir, 2016)</td></tr><tr><td>Factors that may  influence</td><td>Increasing age (Hou et  al., 2019)  Family history  Head Injury  Cardiovascular  diseases (Leszek et al., 2021)  Environmental toxins  (Vasefi et al., 2020)</td><td>Increasing age (Hou et  al., 2019)  Family history  Head Injury  Male gender (Picillo  et al., 2017)</td></tr><tr><td>Onset ages</td><td>First symptoms usually  appear in the mid-60s.

PD does not obviously reduce the lifespan</td></tr></tbody></table><p>When it comes to epidemiology, four key elements come to stand revealed on the paper: how much, when, where and whom. From Statista (2021), Official death certificates are recorded to be 37 in 100,000 for AD and 10.3 in 100,000 in PD in 2019 in the United States. AD has turned into the seventh single biggest killer in the world (WHO, 2019) and the sixth leading cause of death in the United States (Alzheimer’s Association, 2020). Followed with AD, PD has become the second most common neurodegenerative disease (Lebouvier 2009).</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202201042354886.gif" alt="image005"></p><p><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Death rate from Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease in the United States from 2000 to 2019 (data is from Statista: John Elflein, 2021; Statista Research Department, 2021)</p><p>The factor “whom” I mentioned above can be illustrated briefly by the following considering ages, sex and so on. There is some evidence to suggest that age is the main risk factor for AD and PD (Hou et al., 2019). According to the research of Cui et al. (2020), the rates of both AD and PD grew consistently with age growing, but this phenomenon is more likely applicable for AD (Figure 2). Even though Cui et al. failed to account for worldwide data, it presents a positive correlation of prevalence of AD and PD as well as the slight difference between each other. </p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202201042354377.jpg" alt="image006"></p><p><strong>Figure 2.</strong> Prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease in China</p><p>(Cui et al., 2020)</p><p>It is a widely held view that females get more possibility at risk of developing AD, while males get a higher risk for vascular dementia (Podcasy &amp; Epperson, 2016). Ample evidence suggests that female PD patients tend to show a more benign symptom for which many scholars hold the view that it is due to the consequence of oestrogen (Picillo et al., 2017). It is essential to bear in mind that there is a possible bias in the sex effect on AD and PD.</p><p>In the 1950s, researchers successively discovered that the presence of Lewy bodies in substantia nigra and locus nucleus patients in PD patients, gradually determining the pathological hallmarks of PD (Xiao-dan, 2017). One of the limitations with this explanation is that in some cases like a mutation of PARK-2, there are no Lewy bodies (Matsumine, 1999). The research team of Arvid and Isamu find that there are dopamine abnormalities in the brain tissue of PD patients then (LeWitt, 2015). According to Dickson (2012) and Kouli (2018), alpha-synuclein accumulates in Lewy bodies and neurites in the brain and peripheral nerves. And it can be pathological hallmarks of PD, in which case, the abnormal cytoplasmic deposits occur in cell bodies. Neuropathologically, senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles can be hallmarks of AD (Sengoku, 2020). Under the action of endonuclease, the cleaved-off extracellular part of APP is the amyloid-β protein (O’Brien &amp; Wong, 2011). The amyloid-β deposition is another hallmark for AD. Analogously, AD and PD both have tau pathology. Braak (1991) holds the view that the magnitude and location of tau deposition might be related to clinical symptoms of AD. The tau pathology is also reported to have an impact on neurons and glia in PD (Dickson 2012). Several observations suggest that there is a link between the dysfunction, even partly, of the mitochondria or the oxidative stress and the neuropathology of AD and PD (Swerdlow, 2018; Jamwal, Blackburn &amp; Elsworth, 2021). Succinctly, AD and PD share both similarities and differences (Table 2).</p><p><strong>Table 2.</strong> Pathological hallmarks of AD and PD</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>AD</th><th>PD</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Pathological hallmarks</td><td>Extracellular  β-amyloid deposits, i.e., senile plaques  Extracellular  β-amyloid deposits, i.e., senile plaques (MSD manuals, 2020)  Nerve cell death in  hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (Akhtar &amp; Sah, 2020)</td><td>Lewy bodies in the  substantia nigra striatum (MSD manuals, 2020)   Synuclein deposition  Degeneration of  neurons in substantia nigra, locus coeruleus and other brainstem dopaminergic  cells (Hansen, 2021)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>All in all, there is a big difference between the pathological characteristics, the affected brain parts and the clinical symptoms of AD and PD. As global life expectancy has increased, proteinopathies of the brain, which particularly affect the elderly, have placed an increasing burden on society. AD and PD invade the patients’ intellectual and emotional health, thereby potentially destroying their lives and family life. AD and PD invade the victim’s intellectual and emotional health, thereby potentially destroying their lives and family. Since there is a long prodromal period, if we can diagnosis those in advance, earlier and timely treatment might be able to be applied (Ubeda-Bañon et al., 2020), thus, sufferings might be relieved. Both PD and AD get involved in broad regions of the nervous system, neurotransmitters and protein aggregation (Kalia &amp; Lang 2015). The difference is that PD mainly happens in substantia nigra, locus coeruleus and other brainstem dopaminergic cells (Hansen, 2021) while AD typically starts in the temporal lobe, in more detail, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (Akhtar &amp; Sah, 2020). No matter how similar or different those diseases are, one issue is certain, it is our biologists’ duty to pull those suffers with PD or AD out of the hell.</p><h1 id="Reference"><a href="#Reference" class="headerlink" title="Reference"></a><strong>Reference</strong></h1><p>Bayer, T.

The earliest written record is that Aristotle (384 to 322 BC) and Erasistratus (304 to 258 BC), two early Greek physician-scientists conducted experiments on animals (Cohen and Loew 1984). In recent years, there is some new archaeological evidence to suggest that humans tried to operate a Neolithic surgery performing trepanation on a cow in 3400-3000 BCE (Ramirez and Froment, 2018). No matter what the behind meaning is, this action may be regarded as the first attempt at animal experiments in human history. When it comes to the modern era, as model biology rides on the locomotive of the rapid development of modern science, model animals become an essential topic in biology. August Krogh (1929), the 1920 Nobel Laureate in Physiology and Medicine, famously and succinctly articulated the selection of a model of a naturally occurring species, often known as the comparative approach: “For a large number of problems there will be some animal of choice or a few such animals on which it can be (most) conveniently studied”. Nowadays, the textbook definition of an animal model “as a living organism with an inherited, naturally acquired, or induced disease state that in one or more ways closely mimics the same phenomenon existing in man” has affected how researchers approach animal models (Wessler, 1976).</p><p>For neuroscience, several factors are supposed to be considered during selecting a model species. The criteria are stated by Davidson et al. (1987) as followed 9 points: 1) suitability as an analogue, 2) information transferability, 3) genetic uniformity, 4) biological background, 5) expense and accessibility, 6) generalizability for an outcome, 7) usability and adaptability of experimental manipulation, 8) environmental status, 9) moral involvement. Considering these criteria, model selection is mostly a matter of personal preference for individual scientists, who must then persuade the rest of the research world that their choice is sound.  Many model animals, such as drosophila, zebrafish, and mice, share physiological, behavioural, and other features with humans, according to modern science. However, these rules have not treated model animals in many details. As far as Wright was concerned in 2002, the goal of an animal model specifies the requirements that it must meet in order to be considered legitimate. As a result, to decide the weights allocated to the different evaluation criteria, any model evaluation approach must consider the goals and needs that a model is designed to meet, as well as the questions it is anticipated to answer. Meanwhile, some argue that specific research should be conducted on intact, live organisms with as little experimental manipulation as feasible to avoid experimenter-induced artefact (Dow, 2007). Otherwise, the experiment, like Schrödinger’s cat (Schrödinger, 1935), will undermine the validity of the outcome. In 2009, a more systemic approach (fig 1) was put forward by van der Staay et. al. At the beginning, an ethical question must be asked: whether it is acceptable? The model evaluation process continues with the question of whether the data generated by the model is reliable and repeatable, implying that deficiencies must be reproducible and behavioural dysfunctions must be quantified using reliable procedures. The model’s face validity, construct validity is then discussed. After that, if the proposed model has predictive validity becomes another problem to be concerned. All these above validities reach requirements, external validity and generalizability of the model is the final step in the model evaluation cycle. Those standards are important, but as we mentioned before, each independent experiment requires various models. Therefore, we are going to discuss 3 general model animals, mice, zebrafish and drosophila as follows.</p><p>In the past decades, a lot of different types of model animals meeting these criteria were proposed and applied, some of which decay while others show strong vitality. PubMed search results by publication on the date (Fig 2) shows that the mice continue to be the powerhouse for bioscience. The other two model animals have also been used thousands of times. The very first reason why they can be the most common model animals is that they are all affordable, usability and adaptability. There is no doubt that the most significant shift in the last decades has been the dramatic increase in the use of mice in research (McCammon, 2015). Eckardt et al. (2011) argued that the mouse appears to be the most prevalent genetically altered animal model for studying novel therapeutic compounds for various illnesses at the moment, for the following reasons. As for genome conservation, 99 per cent of human genes have homologues in mice (Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium et al., 2002). Therefore, generalizability for the outcome is doubtless accessible. The use of mouse models to evaluate pharmacological targets and develop effective and safe dose schemes for combination therapies in humans has proven successful. These scenarios all have one thing in common: they don’t seek out to fully simulate a disease or disease mechanisms, but rather to gather relevant functional data. In this case, rough modelling refers to an efficient method. As for new models involving the mouse, pathological processes in human-mouse chimaeras can be uncovered by combining cellular and whole-animal techniques. To create human and mouse hybrids, human iPSCs are injected into blastula of a mouse, or tissue from human is implanted into immune-deficient mice that are older (Eckardt et al., 2011). Due to evolutionary similarities and historical reasons, mice are estimated to be the most used species to model human diseases and many other diseases. However, it is not possible to fully replicate all symptoms for one certain strain. The details are also very important when doing experiments, which is why there are specific protocols.</p><p>The mouse is a good model animal with many advantages; however, it is not the only solution or the best choice for some questions. Both the basic macro-organization of the brain and cellular morphology are strikingly comparable in zebrafish and mammalian models, the mouse for example (Kalueff, Stewart &amp; Gerlai, 2014). The intermediate complexity of Danio rerio makes it appropriate for brain study and drug testing. It has a genetic structure that is similar to primates and a physiology that is comparable to mammals. A genetically tractable species with a sequenced genome and a broad toolset for genetic alteration, the zebrafish, like a drosophila. (Elena, 2018). The genomes of zebrafish and mammals are highly similar, with the zebrafish genome containing more than 80% of human disease genes (Howe et al., 2013). McCammon (2015) holds the view that the zebrafish is a human-like animal model that blends experimental tractability with conservation. They are quite inexpensive to keep and maintain, and they generate a high number of embryos. A considerable standard of molecular, cellular, morphological, and developmental conservation, fast temporary hereditary tests, ability for editing gene, imaging of living organism, behaviours with characteristics, multiple-diseases research, and suitability for identifying putative medicines of chemical screening    are among the zebrafish’s significant attributes for addressing psychiatric disorders. The zebrafish is an excellent model organism for studying the neurological underpinnings of natural behaviour. This has been made possible by a number of technologies, including new advances in animal monitoring, computational analysis of behaviour, functional imaging of the whole brain, and methods for specific circuits and genetic manipulation. (Orger and De Polavieja 2017). In conclusion, zebrafish genetics is best adapted to large amount transient analyses, especially variant analysis and genetic interactions. However, there are also substantial disadvantages to using zebrafish models in the neuroscience research. Even though combining chemical substances with water is a simple way to do pharmacological manipulations, Chemicals can be quickly metabolized through skin and gills, based on the surface area of a particular fish and gill activity, therefore such experiments couldn’t appropriately manage the medication amount taken (Rubinstein, 2006). Furthermore, from the results from Chatterjee and Gerlai (2009), zebrafish pharmacokinetic studies are still limited, and the amount of drug that reaches different target tissues is poorly explored, despite the fact that its presence and amount in the CNS can be confirmed using various chemo-analytical methods such as mass spectroscopy or high-performance liquid chromatography. The above reasons are partly why we introduce an insect as follows.</p><p>There is a smaller and simpler model animal that can be competent for a job the above two animals can’t replace. Drosophila melanogaster, a well-known model animal, was famous for the finding of the concept of heritable qualities being carried on chromosomes, as well as many other ground-breaking genetic findings (Morgan 1911). The genome of drosophila was sequenced as the first main for the first time in the modern era (Adams et al., 2000). But why is drosophila a suitable model for neuroscience? Elena et al. (2018) suggest that many of these species are excellent models for understanding the cellular circuits underlying behaviour and physiology, neurotransmission, sensory perception, and plasticity, as well as the cellular basis of learning and memory at the level of the individual cell, due to the simpler organisation of the invertebrate nervous system and the presence of many accessible neurons of surprisingly large sizes at landmark locations throughout the central nervous system. Another benefit of using drosophila as a model is that the life cycle of the fly is quite short. In 10 to 12 days at 25°C, a single viable mating pair can generate hundreds of genetically identical offspring. This is in contrast to standard mouse models, which generate just a few offspring every three to four months (Pandey, 2011). At the gene level, the fly has a number of distinguishing characteristics that make it an appealing model to examine. The genome of drosophila is entirely sequenced and annotated, which encodes for more than 14,000 genes on totally four chromosomes, with three of four carrying the majority of the genome. Almost 75 per cent of genes linked to disease in humans have functioning orthologs in the drosophila, according to estimates (Reiter et al., 2001). Of course, when transferring proteins like A-beta or alpha-synuclein to fruit flies to build a disease model, someone will question: if you transfer a protein that this organism does not have originally at all, there may be some symptoms. But what is the point and whether it is meaningful or not? Moreover, the evolutionary difference between this kind of creature and human beings is too far regarding the rodent. Based on this statement, it is generally believed that the drosophila is suitable for large-scale screening, for instance, RNAi or EMS mutagenesis belonging to reverse or forward screen and the existing resources are abundant. (Pandey 2011) Experiments such as imaging behaviour are easy to operate and easy to raise. There is a big gap, but at least the targets that are worthy of in-depth selection can be screened out in the early stage. However, with the emergence of new technologies such as RNAi in mice (Slobodan 2013), these advantages may gradually weaken, but it is undeniable that some people still make models of such small animals.</p><p>All in all, these model animals do a firm favourite to the development of neuroscience. On the other hand, the contributions to this issue show that a range of less common and, at times, more specialised animal model systems are used to make numerous breakthroughs in neuroscience. Our understanding of evolutionarily conserved core processes and adaptive solutions that are basic to CNS function across phyla has improved thanks to research employing this diverse set of models (Elena 2018). Advances in stimulus delivery, behavioural monitoring, and the measurement and modulation of brain activity have made model animals behaviour more accurate and experimentally accessible in naturalistic settings. The rapid pace of research in this area should result in more quantitative modelling approaches, a better understanding of behaviour ontogeny, and better optical tools, making mice, zebrafish and drosophila an appealing system not only for genetics and development research but also for investigating the neural circuit basis of complex behaviours (Orger and De Polavieja 2017). In neuroscience research, model animals will add a rich and colourful stroke to the annals of history. The next century will be illuminated as more and more new animal models are being designed and put into use. The building of biology is waiting for us to add bricks and mortar. Zebrafish is an ideal species to study the neurobiological basis of natural behaviour.</p><h2 id="Figures-and-Tables"><a href="#Figures-and-Tables" class="headerlink" title="Figures and Tables"></a>Figures and Tables</h2><p><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/11/29/oKaJMD.png" alt="oKaJMD.png"></p><p><strong>Figure 1.</strong> assessment for animal models with moral and scientific assessment standards (van der Staay, 2009)</p><p><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/11/29/oKadII.png" alt="oKadII.png"></p><p><strong>Figure 2.</strong> PubMed results by publication indexed on the date, 1950 through 2020.

The dynamic process of a lens’ morphological transformation is caused by the changes in the radius of the ciliary muscle (Helmholtz 1909), during which the curving covering diameters of the lens on both sides reduce, resulting in a raising power of refraction (Glasser 2006), then the lens will be accommodated (Figure 1).</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202202171345007.gif" alt="img"></p><p><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Contraction of the ciliary muscle results to an accommodation (Land 2005)</p><p><strong>Blind spot:</strong> The blind spot is a small region in the field of vision correlating to the location of the optic disc (Figure 2) without image detection (Gamm, Albert &amp; Daniel 2020), from which is the cranial nerve II penetrates so that there are no photoreceptors in the optic disc (Ramachandran 1992). </p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202202171346685.jpg" alt="Find Your Blind Spot!"></p><p><strong>Figure 2.</strong> Location of blind spot (Lohner 2020).</p><p><strong>Cones and rods:</strong> Cones and rods are the two kinds of photoreceptors (Figure 3) in the retina of the vertebrate retina (Schwiegerling 2004). The cones show responsibility to the bright light and colour sensitivity while cones are responsible for dim light (Schultze M 1866).</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202202171348845.gif" alt="Differentiation between Cones and Rods (Ingram et al.2016)"></p><p><strong>Figure 3.</strong> Differentiation between Cones and Rods (Ingram et al. 2016)</p><p><strong>Directionally selective ganglion cells:</strong> Directionally selective ganglion cells are a group of retinal ganglion cells that can detect motions in different directions. They can respond actively to a movement from the chosen direction with a high postsynaptic potential after an inhibitory spike (Borst 2011) while active infrequently in response to opposite-direction movement of the same item (Barlow 1963). </p><p><strong>Fovea Centralis:</strong> Fovea Centralis is a tiny fossa in the centre of eyes (Figure 4) composed of cones densely located in the middle of the macula lutea (Iwasaki &amp; Inomata 1986). Foveal vision is functioned by this area and is responsible for distinct item characteristics, such as form and location (Lettvin 1976).</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202202171350909.jpg" alt="img"></p><p><strong>Figure 4.</strong> Fovea centralis anatomy in human eyes</p><p><strong>Photopigment:</strong>  Photopigment is a transmembrane protein held inside photoreceptors functioning for light perception situated in plates of film in the external fragment of a pole or cone (Fu 2010). The purpose is to absorb incident light and afterwards produce a cascade reaction to change the electrical characters of the photoreceptors, in which case trigger the release of glutamate (Hart 2009). </p><p><strong>Photoreception:</strong> Photoreception is a process that photoreceptors for instance cones and rods retain light waves which are captured by eyes then convert the electromagnetic signs into electrochemical signs which are then shipped off the cerebrum for visual handling invertebrate animals (Foster et al. 1991). The whole process converts light stimulus to nerve impulse at last with help from specialised photoreceptors in the retina.</p><p><strong>Phototransduction:</strong> Phototransduction is an interaction by which electromagnetic energy is changed over into electrical chemical energy in cone cells, rod cells and retinal photosensitive ganglion cells in the eyes (Kusakabe et al. 2009). This process includes a series of primary biochemical and physiological actions, which is also known as “Wald’s Visual Cycle” (Figure 5).</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202202171351871.jpg" alt="4: Wald&#39;s visual cycle. Blue color represents reactions in... | Download  Scientific Diagram"></p><p><strong>Figure 5.</strong> Wald’s Visual Cycle (Vasudevan et al. 2017)</p><p><strong>Retina:</strong> The retina is the inverted tissue component toward the rear of the eyes (Figure 6) that detects light after cones and rods and sends processed information to the cerebrum. It is a photoreceptor and glial cells layer that catches approaching photons and sends them along neuronal pathways as both electrical and synthetic signs (Nguyen et al. 2021).</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202202171351226.jpg" alt="Illustration of retina anatomy"></p><p><strong>Figure 6.</strong> Retina anatomy (Heiting 2019)</p><p><strong>Rhodopsin:</strong> Rhodopsin is a kind of light-sensitive G-protein coupled receptor protein (GPCR) (Figure 7) (Lenaan et al. 2020) functioning during vision Wald’s visual cycle. As a photo switchable opsin, one kind of photopigment found in retinal rods, it can be activated in a very low light environment (Litmann 1996).</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202202171352248.gif" alt="img"></p><p><strong>Figure 7.</strong> 3D view of rhodopsin model (1F88)</p><h2 id="References"><a href="#References" class="headerlink" title="References:"></a><strong>References:</strong></h2><p>Helmholtz, H. &amp; Southall, J.
