This is not a circular argument because he found these drugs also affect punishment-related behaviour in rodents, increasing approach to locations or stimuli that have been associated with painful electric shock.\n\nExtended and refined by Philip Corr and Neil McNaughton: This has resulted in the key theory of defensive direction, which splits general punishment/threat sensitivity into sensitivity to threats that require approach  (anxiety-proneness) and sensitivity to threats that need not be approached\n(fear-proneness).\n\nSøren Kierkegaard, The Concept of Anxiety (1844): Anxiety informs us of our choices, our self-awareness and personal responsibility, and brings us from a state of un-self-conscious immediacy to self-conscious reflection.\n\n**How can we test abstract anxiety objectively?**\n\nThe moral dilemma task\n\n![Lorazepam studies](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202203302004197.png)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis research (Adam Perkins) shows that the same anti-anxiety drug affects responses to threat and moral judgment, suggesting that the same brain systems underlie both processes and that previously abstract philosophical concepts may be explained in functional, evolutionary terms.\n\n\n\n# Vocabularies\n\n**Entrainment**:  the process of making something have the same pattern or rhythm as something else\n\n**BCI**: brain computer interface\n\n**Lorazepam**: a drug of the benzodiazepine group, used especially to treat anxiety.\n","slug":"08_03_22","published":1,"updated":"2022-04-06T15:02:11.908Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cl77ttydu000ff8weuux8edlj"},{"title":"Lecture Notes 09/02/22","top":false,"cover":false,"toc":true,"mathjax":true,"date":"2022-02-09T18:00:00.000Z","password":null,"summary":null,"_content":"\n## Abstract\n\nquick overviews (**What you have done**) avoid to use 'I will'\n\nkey words\n\n### How\n\nthe key is structure\n\n| Background/introduction | 25%  |\n| ----------------------- | ---- |\n| Method                  | 25%  |\n| conclusion              | 35%  |\n| results                 | 15%  |\n\n#### Background/introduction  \n\ngive starting point, get the salient points across\n\nbe tailored to the level that you expect the audience have\n\n##### Aim/objective\n\nmost important part\n\nshort, relevant, specific and measurable\n\n#### Methods\n\nvariable (can be in detail or succinctly depending on the projects)\n\noutcome measure and how to measure (secondary one can be absence if there is a word limitation)\n\nstatistical method, how it is important\n\n#### Results\n\nrelevant values (like p-values; in correlation, like r value)\n\n#### Conclusions/implications\n\nstudied' contribution\n\nTake-home message\n\nit is good to relate it back to the aim \n\nno specific number\n\ncan add future direction\n\n## Task\n\n### Background/introduction \n\nThe previous research has stated that social cues could play an important role in one's socioemotional regulation.

In this case, these proteins might not only lose their original normal function but also gain toxicity (Luheshi et al., 2008). Speaking of proteinopathies, two diseases must be mentioned: One is Parkinson’s disease (PD), the most famous progressive neurodegenerative diseases associated with motor as well as nonmotor deficits, which is known as the second common neurodegenerative disorder, (Capriotti & Terzakis, 2016; Simon et al., 2020; Hayes, 2019); the other one is Alzheimer’s disease (AD), one of the most major reason for dementia, the most common neurodegenerative disorder (Lane, Hardy & Schott, 2018). There are around one billion sufferers around the world who are suffering both physical and psychological agony from these neurodegenerative disorders in 2019 (Bulck et al., 2019). Various factors, for instance genomic, epigenomic, metabolic, or environmental factors (Bulck et al., 2019), are shown to have an impact on PD and AD in a permutation and combination way. Here this essay will go into detail about these two common proteinopathies in three aspects: clinical symptoms, epidemiology and pathological hallmarks.\n\nIn terms of clinical symptoms between PD and AD, multiple similar as well as differing pathological phenotypes can be identified, which is treated under the comparison and contrast between PD and AD (Table 1). PD and AD are both irreversible progressive, degenerative diseases meaning the symptoms will gradually become more severe as the stages develop. The most obvious problems about patients’ cognitive and psychiatric symptoms come first as we consider these neurodegenerative diseases. As far as we know, AD is well-known for its influence on memory, academically called amnesia which was first conceptualized as memory loss in 1763 by Sauvagues (Langer, 2019). Most of the advanced AD sufferers are reported to have Amnesia symptoms, accounting for fifty per cent to seventy per cent of all patients with dementia (Burns & Iliffe 2009), while it seldomly happens to PD patients. Only the most severe PD sufferers are reported to experience similar amnesia symptoms (Querfurth & LaFerla, 2010). At the memory level, patients with AD not only have amnesia but also often experience memory distortions (El Haj et al. 2020, Younan et al., 2020), such as having comprehensive and vivid memories of episodic occurrences that have never been observed. AD symptoms are generally considered as an essential impairment of episodic memory (Younan et al., 2020), while one’s attention is compromised on AD’s early stage as well, especially in those with early age onset and atypical syndromes (Malhotra, 2018). One feature of AD is that the symptoms are accompanied by severe attentional impairment frequently which is linked with other neurodegenerative disorders as well (Malhotra, 2018). It is suggested that PD patients suffer more depression and anxiety (Sveinbjornsdottir, 2016) than AD patients, which may be concluded to the inconsistency between one’s movements and willingness.\n\nApart from memory problems for AD and PD, some other motor symptoms can also put huge inconvenience to one’s life. PD patients are reported to have three main symptoms which are tremor, bradykinesia and rigidity (Hayes, 2019). Tremor means shaking, especially after a short pause of a postural movement. Bradykinesia implies a slower movement than normal action which may cause difficulties for some ordinary tasks like walking or doing dishes. Rigidity or spasticity refers to muscle stiffness, which is academically called dystonia (Tolosa & Compta, 2006). Unlike those symptoms in AD, these three main symptoms in PD are more relying on the neuromuscular connection so that these are all related to muscle control abnormality which is the direct result of neurodegeneration the same as AD (McGregor & Nelson, 2019). Similarly, AD patients also suffer motor problems like dysphagia referring to the difficulty in swallowing, which is also reported in eleven to eighty-one per cent of PD patients (Takizawa et al., 2016). Patients with AD gradually lose cognitive functions until they reach the final stage of the disease, which is characterised by full failure of control over body functions (Boccardi et al., 2016).\n\nRegarding the nonmotor symptoms, anosmia (the sense loss of smell) and ageusia (the sense loss of taste), are common in PD. And the equivalent olfactory loss is also observed in AD (Doty 2012), which may be contributed to the shared pathological features. It may be corroborated that the olfactory loss is significantly linked to cognitive level (Tarakad & Jankovic, 2017). This is different from PD: AD patients show more cognitive impairments. There occur some other cognitive problems in AD more than memory. For example, one type of language disorder, aphasia is usually related to AD owing to the damage of frontal, temporal, or parietal language cortices. And these aphasias caused by AD accounts for nearly thirty per cent of primary degenerative aphasias (Teichmann & Ferrieux, 2013). The problems are not only about daily life activity but also about the biological clock. Sleep disturbances and sleep disorders come to be big problems for AD and PD patients since these are long term and progressive diseases. (Peter-Derex, 2015). Sleep disorders, on the other hand, is reported to be linked to an increased risk of AD. Both situations have a negative impact on one’s attention (Hennawy et al., 2019). Insomnia and exhaustion are also the following side effects of sleep disorders. Together with physical discomfort, those symptoms above can cause psychological discomfort in PD when comparing PD and AD. Neuralgia has become a severe problem for patients. There are five main forms of pain are documented in PD sufferers which are separately dystonia, musculoskeletal pain, nerve or nerve root pain, primary or central pain and akathisia with some samples (Rana 2013). \n\nTo sum up, AD and PD symptoms are generally different, but these share some key features at the same time. PD patients are more likely to have primarily motor abnormalities, whereas AD patients normally experience dementia and cognitive impairment (Meireles & Massano 2012). The neuronal death is a typical feature of both illnesses, the autopsy histopathology of the brains from AD and PD patients are distinct in each instance and diverse from one another (Ganguly et al., 2017). AD focuses more on cognitive symptoms while PD focus more on physical symptoms even though these can be divided into motor and nonmotor symptoms.\n\n \n\n**Table 1.** Comparison and contrast table of Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease in symptoms, causes, onset age, treatment, and lifespan expectancy.\n\n|                             | AD                                                           | PD                                                           |\n| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Clinical symptoms           | Amnesia (El Haj et  al., 2020)  Impairments of  attention (Malhotra, 2018)  Disorder of episodic  memory (Younan et al., 2020)  Memory distortions (El  Haj et al. 2020)  Dysphagia (Boccardi et  al., 2016)  Dysphasia (Teichmann  & Ferrieux, 2013)  Sleep disruption and  sleep disorders (Hennawy et al., 2019) | Tremor  Bradykinesia  Rigidity (NHS, 2019)  Loss of balance  Anosmia and ageusia  (Doty, 2012; Tarakad & Jankovic, 2017)  Neuralgia (Rana et  al., 2013)  Urinary infection (Gerlach,  Winogrodzka & Weber 2011)  Depression, anxiety  (Sveinbjornsdottir, 2016) |\n| Factors that may  influence | Increasing age (Hou et  al., 2019)  Family history  Head Injury  Cardiovascular  diseases (Leszek et al., 2021)  Environmental toxins  (Vasefi et al., 2020) | Increasing age (Hou et  al., 2019)  Family history  Head Injury  Male gender (Picillo  et al., 2017) |\n| Onset ages                  | First symptoms usually  appear in the mid-60s.

PD does not obviously reduce the lifespan |\n\n \n\nWhen it comes to epidemiology, four key elements come to stand revealed on the paper: how much, when, where and whom. From Statista (2021), Official death certificates are recorded to be 37 in 100,000 for AD and 10.3 in 100,000 in PD in 2019 in the United States. AD has turned into the seventh single biggest killer in the world (WHO, 2019) and the sixth leading cause of death in the United States (Alzheimer's Association, 2020). Followed with AD, PD has become the second most common neurodegenerative disease (Lebouvier 2009).\n\n \n\n![image005](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202201042354886.gif)\n\n**Figure 1.** Death rate from Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer’s disease in the United States from 2000 to 2019 (data is from Statista: John Elflein, 2021; Statista Research Department, 2021)\n\n \n\nThe factor “whom” I mentioned above can be illustrated briefly by the following considering ages, sex and so on. There is some evidence to suggest that age is the main risk factor for AD and PD (Hou et al., 2019). According to the research of Cui et al. (2020), the rates of both AD and PD grew consistently with age growing, but this phenomenon is more likely applicable for AD (Figure 2). Even though Cui et al. failed to account for worldwide data, it presents a positive correlation of prevalence of AD and PD as well as the slight difference between each other. \n\n \n\n![image006](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202201042354377.jpg)\n\n**Figure 2.** Prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease in China\n\n(Cui et al., 2020)\n\n \n\nIt is a widely held view that females get more possibility at risk of developing AD, while males get a higher risk for vascular dementia (Podcasy & Epperson, 2016). Ample evidence suggests that female PD patients tend to show a more benign symptom for which many scholars hold the view that it is due to the consequence of oestrogen (Picillo et al., 2017). It is essential to bear in mind that there is a possible bias in the sex effect on AD and PD.\n\nIn the 1950s, researchers successively discovered that the presence of Lewy bodies in substantia nigra and locus nucleus patients in PD patients, gradually determining the pathological hallmarks of PD (Xiao-dan, 2017). One of the limitations with this explanation is that in some cases like a mutation of PARK-2, there are no Lewy bodies (Matsumine, 1999). The research team of Arvid and Isamu find that there are dopamine abnormalities in the brain tissue of PD patients then (LeWitt, 2015). According to Dickson (2012) and Kouli (2018), alpha-synuclein accumulates in Lewy bodies and neurites in the brain and peripheral nerves. And it can be pathological hallmarks of PD, in which case, the abnormal cytoplasmic deposits occur in cell bodies. Neuropathologically, senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles can be hallmarks of AD (Sengoku, 2020). Under the action of endonuclease, the cleaved-off extracellular part of APP is the amyloid-β protein (O'Brien & Wong, 2011). The amyloid-β deposition is another hallmark for AD. Analogously, AD and PD both have tau pathology. Braak (1991) holds the view that the magnitude and location of tau deposition might be related to clinical symptoms of AD. The tau pathology is also reported to have an impact on neurons and glia in PD (Dickson 2012). Several observations suggest that there is a link between the dysfunction, even partly, of the mitochondria or the oxidative stress and the neuropathology of AD and PD (Swerdlow, 2018; Jamwal, Blackburn & Elsworth, 2021). Succinctly, AD and PD share both similarities and differences (Table 2).\n\n \n\n**Table 2.** Pathological hallmarks of AD and PD\n\n|                        | AD                                                           | PD                                                           |\n| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Pathological hallmarks | Extracellular  β-amyloid deposits, i.e., senile plaques  Extracellular  β-amyloid deposits, i.e., senile plaques (MSD manuals, 2020)  Nerve cell death in  hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (Akhtar & Sah, 2020) | Lewy bodies in the  substantia nigra striatum (MSD manuals, 2020)   Synuclein deposition  Degeneration of  neurons in substantia nigra, locus coeruleus and other brainstem dopaminergic  cells (Hansen, 2021) |\n\n \n\nAll in all, there is a big difference between the pathological characteristics, the affected brain parts and the clinical symptoms of AD and PD. As global life expectancy has increased, proteinopathies of the brain, which particularly affect the elderly, have placed an increasing burden on society. AD and PD invade the patients’ intellectual and emotional health, thereby potentially destroying their lives and family life. AD and PD invade the victim's intellectual and emotional health, thereby potentially destroying their lives and family. Since there is a long prodromal period, if we can diagnosis those in advance, earlier and timely treatment might be able to be applied (Ubeda-Bañon et al., 2020), thus, sufferings might be relieved. Both PD and AD get involved in broad regions of the nervous system, neurotransmitters and protein aggregation (Kalia & Lang 2015). The difference is that PD mainly happens in substantia nigra, locus coeruleus and other brainstem dopaminergic cells (Hansen, 2021) while AD typically starts in the temporal lobe, in more detail, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (Akhtar & Sah, 2020). No matter how similar or different those diseases are, one issue is certain, it is our biologists’ duty to pull those suffers with PD or AD out of the hell.\n\n# **Reference**\n\nBayer, T. A. (2015).

In this case, these proteins might not only lose their original normal function but also gain toxicity (Luheshi et al., 2008). Speaking of proteinopathies, two diseases must be mentioned: One is Parkinson’s disease (PD), the most famous progressive neurodegenerative diseases associated with motor as well as nonmotor deficits, which is known as the second common neurodegenerative disorder, (Capriotti & Terzakis, 2016; Simon et al., 2020; Hayes, 2019); the other one is Alzheimer’s disease (AD), one of the most major reason for dementia, the most common neurodegenerative disorder (Lane, Hardy & Schott, 2018). There are around one billion sufferers around the world who are suffering both physical and psychological agony from these neurodegenerative disorders in 2019 (Bulck et al., 2019). Various factors, for instance genomic, epigenomic, metabolic, or environmental factors (Bulck et al., 2019), are shown to have an impact on PD and AD in a permutation and combination way. Here this essay will go into detail about these two common proteinopathies in three aspects: clinical symptoms, epidemiology and pathological hallmarks.\n\nIn terms of clinical symptoms between PD and AD, multiple similar as well as differing pathological phenotypes can be identified, which is treated under the comparison and contrast between PD and AD (Table 1). PD and AD are both irreversible progressive, degenerative diseases meaning the symptoms will gradually become more severe as the stages develop. The most obvious problems about patients’ cognitive and psychiatric symptoms come first as we consider these neurodegenerative diseases. As far as we know, AD is well-known for its influence on memory, academically called amnesia which was first conceptualized as memory loss in 1763 by Sauvagues (Langer, 2019). Most of the advanced AD sufferers are reported to have Amnesia symptoms, accounting for fifty per cent to seventy per cent of all patients with dementia (Burns & Iliffe 2009), while it seldomly happens to PD patients. Only the most severe PD sufferers are reported to experience similar amnesia symptoms (Querfurth & LaFerla, 2010). At the memory level, patients with AD not only have amnesia but also often experience memory distortions (El Haj et al. 2020, Younan et al., 2020), such as having comprehensive and vivid memories of episodic occurrences that have never been observed. AD symptoms are generally considered as an essential impairment of episodic memory (Younan et al., 2020), while one’s attention is compromised on AD’s early stage as well, especially in those with early age onset and atypical syndromes (Malhotra, 2018). One feature of AD is that the symptoms are accompanied by severe attentional impairment frequently which is linked with other neurodegenerative disorders as well (Malhotra, 2018). It is suggested that PD patients suffer more depression and anxiety (Sveinbjornsdottir, 2016) than AD patients, which may be concluded to the inconsistency between one’s movements and willingness.\n\nApart from memory problems for AD and PD, some other motor symptoms can also put huge inconvenience to one’s life. PD patients are reported to have three main symptoms which are tremor, bradykinesia and rigidity (Hayes, 2019). Tremor means shaking, especially after a short pause of a postural movement. Bradykinesia implies a slower movement than normal action which may cause difficulties for some ordinary tasks like walking or doing dishes. Rigidity or spasticity refers to muscle stiffness, which is academically called dystonia (Tolosa & Compta, 2006). Unlike those symptoms in AD, these three main symptoms in PD are more relying on the neuromuscular connection so that these are all related to muscle control abnormality which is the direct result of neurodegeneration the same as AD (McGregor & Nelson, 2019). Similarly, AD patients also suffer motor problems like dysphagia referring to the difficulty in swallowing, which is also reported in eleven to eighty-one per cent of PD patients (Takizawa et al., 2016). Patients with AD gradually lose cognitive functions until they reach the final stage of the disease, which is characterised by full failure of control over body functions (Boccardi et al., 2016).\n\nRegarding the nonmotor symptoms, anosmia (the sense loss of smell) and ageusia (the sense loss of taste), are common in PD. And the equivalent olfactory loss is also observed in AD (Doty 2012), which may be contributed to the shared pathological features. It may be corroborated that the olfactory loss is significantly linked to cognitive level (Tarakad & Jankovic, 2017). This is different from PD: AD patients show more cognitive impairments. There occur some other cognitive problems in AD more than memory. For example, one type of language disorder, aphasia is usually related to AD owing to the damage of frontal, temporal, or parietal language cortices. And these aphasias caused by AD accounts for nearly thirty per cent of primary degenerative aphasias (Teichmann & Ferrieux, 2013). The problems are not only about daily life activity but also about the biological clock. Sleep disturbances and sleep disorders come to be big problems for AD and PD patients since these are long term and progressive diseases. (Peter-Derex, 2015). Sleep disorders, on the other hand, is reported to be linked to an increased risk of AD. Both situations have a negative impact on one’s attention (Hennawy et al., 2019). Insomnia and exhaustion are also the following side effects of sleep disorders. Together with physical discomfort, those symptoms above can cause psychological discomfort in PD when comparing PD and AD. Neuralgia has become a severe problem for patients. There are five main forms of pain are documented in PD sufferers which are separately dystonia, musculoskeletal pain, nerve or nerve root pain, primary or central pain and akathisia with some samples (Rana 2013). \n\nTo sum up, AD and PD symptoms are generally different, but these share some key features at the same time. PD patients are more likely to have primarily motor abnormalities, whereas AD patients normally experience dementia and cognitive impairment (Meireles & Massano 2012). The neuronal death is a typical feature of both illnesses, the autopsy histopathology of the brains from AD and PD patients are distinct in each instance and diverse from one another (Ganguly et al., 2017). AD focuses more on cognitive symptoms while PD focus more on physical symptoms even though these can be divided into motor and nonmotor symptoms.\n\n \n\n**Table 1.** Comparison and contrast table of Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease in symptoms, causes, onset age, treatment, and lifespan expectancy.\n\n|                             | AD                                                           | PD                                                           |\n| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Clinical symptoms           | Amnesia (El Haj et  al., 2020)  Impairments of  attention (Malhotra, 2018)  Disorder of episodic  memory (Younan et al., 2020)  Memory distortions (El  Haj et al. 2020)  Dysphagia (Boccardi et  al., 2016)  Dysphasia (Teichmann  & Ferrieux, 2013)  Sleep disruption and  sleep disorders (Hennawy et al., 2019) | Tremor  Bradykinesia  Rigidity (NHS, 2019)  Loss of balance  Anosmia and ageusia  (Doty, 2012; Tarakad & Jankovic, 2017)  Neuralgia (Rana et  al., 2013)  Urinary infection (Gerlach,  Winogrodzka & Weber 2011)  Depression, anxiety  (Sveinbjornsdottir, 2016) |\n| Factors that may  influence | Increasing age (Hou et  al., 2019)  Family history  Head Injury  Cardiovascular  diseases (Leszek et al., 2021)  Environmental toxins  (Vasefi et al., 2020) | Increasing age (Hou et  al., 2019)  Family history  Head Injury  Male gender (Picillo  et al., 2017) |\n| Onset ages                  | First symptoms usually  appear in the mid-60s.

PD does not obviously reduce the lifespan |\n\n \n\nWhen it comes to epidemiology, four key elements come to stand revealed on the paper: how much, when, where and whom. From Statista (2021), Official death certificates are recorded to be 37 in 100,000 for AD and 10.3 in 100,000 in PD in 2019 in the United States. AD has turned into the seventh single biggest killer in the world (WHO, 2019) and the sixth leading cause of death in the United States (Alzheimer's Association, 2020). Followed with AD, PD has become the second most common neurodegenerative disease (Lebouvier 2009).\n\n \n\n![image005](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202201042354886.gif)\n\n**Figure 1.** Death rate from Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer’s disease in the United States from 2000 to 2019 (data is from Statista: John Elflein, 2021; Statista Research Department, 2021)\n\n \n\nThe factor “whom” I mentioned above can be illustrated briefly by the following considering ages, sex and so on. There is some evidence to suggest that age is the main risk factor for AD and PD (Hou et al., 2019). According to the research of Cui et al. (2020), the rates of both AD and PD grew consistently with age growing, but this phenomenon is more likely applicable for AD (Figure 2). Even though Cui et al. failed to account for worldwide data, it presents a positive correlation of prevalence of AD and PD as well as the slight difference between each other. \n\n \n\n![image006](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202201042354377.jpg)\n\n**Figure 2.** Prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease in China\n\n(Cui et al., 2020)\n\n \n\nIt is a widely held view that females get more possibility at risk of developing AD, while males get a higher risk for vascular dementia (Podcasy & Epperson, 2016). Ample evidence suggests that female PD patients tend to show a more benign symptom for which many scholars hold the view that it is due to the consequence of oestrogen (Picillo et al., 2017). It is essential to bear in mind that there is a possible bias in the sex effect on AD and PD.\n\nIn the 1950s, researchers successively discovered that the presence of Lewy bodies in substantia nigra and locus nucleus patients in PD patients, gradually determining the pathological hallmarks of PD (Xiao-dan, 2017). One of the limitations with this explanation is that in some cases like a mutation of PARK-2, there are no Lewy bodies (Matsumine, 1999). The research team of Arvid and Isamu find that there are dopamine abnormalities in the brain tissue of PD patients then (LeWitt, 2015). According to Dickson (2012) and Kouli (2018), alpha-synuclein accumulates in Lewy bodies and neurites in the brain and peripheral nerves. And it can be pathological hallmarks of PD, in which case, the abnormal cytoplasmic deposits occur in cell bodies. Neuropathologically, senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles can be hallmarks of AD (Sengoku, 2020). Under the action of endonuclease, the cleaved-off extracellular part of APP is the amyloid-β protein (O'Brien & Wong, 2011). The amyloid-β deposition is another hallmark for AD. Analogously, AD and PD both have tau pathology. Braak (1991) holds the view that the magnitude and location of tau deposition might be related to clinical symptoms of AD. The tau pathology is also reported to have an impact on neurons and glia in PD (Dickson 2012). Several observations suggest that there is a link between the dysfunction, even partly, of the mitochondria or the oxidative stress and the neuropathology of AD and PD (Swerdlow, 2018; Jamwal, Blackburn & Elsworth, 2021). Succinctly, AD and PD share both similarities and differences (Table 2).\n\n \n\n**Table 2.** Pathological hallmarks of AD and PD\n\n|                        | AD                                                           | PD                                                           |\n| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Pathological hallmarks | Extracellular  β-amyloid deposits, i.e., senile plaques  Extracellular  β-amyloid deposits, i.e., senile plaques (MSD manuals, 2020)  Nerve cell death in  hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (Akhtar & Sah, 2020) | Lewy bodies in the  substantia nigra striatum (MSD manuals, 2020)   Synuclein deposition  Degeneration of  neurons in substantia nigra, locus coeruleus and other brainstem dopaminergic  cells (Hansen, 2021) |\n\n \n\nAll in all, there is a big difference between the pathological characteristics, the affected brain parts and the clinical symptoms of AD and PD. As global life expectancy has increased, proteinopathies of the brain, which particularly affect the elderly, have placed an increasing burden on society. AD and PD invade the patients’ intellectual and emotional health, thereby potentially destroying their lives and family life. AD and PD invade the victim's intellectual and emotional health, thereby potentially destroying their lives and family. Since there is a long prodromal period, if we can diagnosis those in advance, earlier and timely treatment might be able to be applied (Ubeda-Bañon et al., 2020), thus, sufferings might be relieved. Both PD and AD get involved in broad regions of the nervous system, neurotransmitters and protein aggregation (Kalia & Lang 2015). The difference is that PD mainly happens in substantia nigra, locus coeruleus and other brainstem dopaminergic cells (Hansen, 2021) while AD typically starts in the temporal lobe, in more detail, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (Akhtar & Sah, 2020). No matter how similar or different those diseases are, one issue is certain, it is our biologists’ duty to pull those suffers with PD or AD out of the hell.\n\n# **Reference**\n\nBayer, T. A. (2015).

As early as 1949, Hebb proposed that learning and memory are stored as changes in the strength of synaptic connections between neurons. Along with the discovery of the LTP phenomenon by Bliss & Lomo (1973) and subsequent research, the hypothesis that the LTP provides a neural basis for learning and memory formation has been widely accepted by the public. The NMDAR-dependent LTP processes in the hippocampus, especially in the CA1 subregion of the hippocampus, are thought to be the neural basis for spatial learning and memory (Martin et al., 2000, Bliss & Collingridge, 1993). The hippocampus consists of four Cornu Ammonis regions (CA1 to CA4) and dentate gyrus (DG), of which CA4 can also be considered part of the DG due to the partial overlap of structure and function (Andersen et al., 2007, Anand & Dhikav, 2012). With the desire of studying hippocampal subregions, one question is proposed: how can we specifically study the subregions? The arrangement of hippocampal neurons allows the hippocampus to be sliced, leaving most of the relevant circuitry intact (Purves, Augustine & Fitzpatrick, 2001). The undamaged circuit of the individual subregions ensures the feasibility and authenticity of our study about each subregion. Thus, in-depth study of each subregion has become a hot topic in the past decades. This essay aims to discuss NMDAR-dependent LTP in different hippocampal subregions can have distinct and similar roles in learning and memory.\n\nLTP can be observed at three main excitatory synapses in the hippocampal circuit, the excitatory synaptic pathway of the hippocampus. In this circuit, the perforant pathway extends from pyramidal cells in the entorhinal area to granule cells in the DG; the mossy fibre pathway extends from granule cells in the DG to CA3 pyramidal cells; Schaffer collateral pathways from CA3 pyramidal cells to CA1 pyramidal cells (Fig 1). Bliss & Collingridge (1993), Nicoll & Malenka (1995) believe that two subregions, CA1 and DG, show NMDAR-dependent LTP. However, their findings do not imply the absence of NMDA receptor-dependent LTP in other hippocampal subregions due to the limitations in-vitro experiments. In 2002, Lee & Kesner collected some data indicating the involvement of NMDAR in CA3, which may be explained as an attractor state (a temporarily self-sustaining state), with a computational model based on physiological evidence and behavioural experiments. In this research, Lee suggested behavioural evidence for differences in NMDAR spatial working memory function among hippocampal subregions. Lee\\'s research eliminates the influence of another type of LTP with the local subregion-specific injection of NMDAR antagonists. As the participation of CA3, the role of the hippocampal NMDAR-dependent LTP might be misunderstood. However, previous research still cannot explain the role in the hippocampal subregions well. The association hypothesis between NMDAR-dependent LTP and learning and memory in hippocampal subregions require more experiments to validate. When we focus on each subregion, their distinct and similar roles in learning and memory may be revealed.\n\n![image-20220216191746673](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202202161917751.png)\n\n**Figure 1**. LTP in Schaffer collateral pathway, mossy fibre pathway and perforant pathway (Chen et al. 1997)\n\nThe CA1 subregion is the neural foundation linking spatial learning and memory. Tsien et. al (1996a, 1996b) knockout the GluN1 subunit (in NMDAR) resulting in the deficit of LTP in Schaffer collateral CA1 synapses finding the spatial reference memory is impaired in mice. This research directly proves that NMDAR-dependent LTP at CA1 synapses is the neural foundation for associative, long-term spatial memory formation. Additionally, CA1-KO mice lack NMDAR-mediated postsynaptic currents and LTP in CA1. These mice showed impaired spatial memory in the Morris hidden platform water maze, in the opposite, performed well on non-spatial learning tasks. The results provide contrastive support for the hypothesis that NMDAR-mediated LTP in the CA1 region is critical for the formation of some specific types of memory. Similarly, spatial learning deficits were reported in mice with the impaired LTP in CA1 owing to the lack of the gene encoding α subunit of calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (αCaMKII) (Silva et al., 1992a, 1992b). These mice lack spatial memory, the same as spatial memory deficits in CA1-KO mice. A possible shortcoming in this experiment is that previous experiments are based on direct injection of NMDAR antagonists into the brain, which may not be sufficiently convincing in terms of regional idiosyncrasy. According to Hestrin\\'s discovery in 1996: NMDAR contributes to synaptic transmission in some regions of the neocortex. We can conclude that memory impairment can be explained, at least in part, by deficits in the computing ability of the neocortex, rather than impairments in synaptic plasticity within the hippocampus. Subsequently, Bannerman et al. (2012) used transgenic mice lacking the GluN1 subunit and NMDARs in the pyramidal cells of CA1 and the granule cells of DG finding that the spatial reference memory of the mice acquired the radial maze task was impaired. It furtherly demonstrates the fact: hippocampal CA1 plays an important role in the learning of spatial reference memory. In 2013, it took a turn when Taylor et al. found that such mice performed well on the classic open-field spatial reference memory water maze task. How can it happen? It possibly indicates that the hippocampal NMDAR is not actually required for the formation of long-term associative spatial memory, which is against Tsien\\'s results. But Taylor does not explain this in detail, thus it cannot determine whether there are any other compensatory mechanisms for NMDA-dependent LTP. Whatever, as Niewoehner et al. (2007) argues, the development of spatially restricted genetic modifications has identified synaptic plasticity, which is a broader idea than LTP, with specific and separable roles in different hippocampal subregions. We may want to see more genetic modification experiments in this field. Despite the shortcomings of these research, the inter-experimental corroboration still demonstrates that CA1 has an irreplaceable role in associative, long-term spatial memory. We can consider CA1 LTP to be the basis of spatial memory formation.\n\nIn the CA2 subregion, NMDA-dependent LTP cannot be induced. Zhao et al. (2007) attempted to test whether synaptic stimulation could induce LTP in CA2 neurons, which is proved to induce NMDAR-dependent LTP in CA1, using a variety of approaches including perforated whole-cell patch-clamp recording. However, all results lead to that the synaptic current is not increased. One of the explanations from Caruana, Alexander, & Dudek (2012) is that the high expression of TREK-1 and TREK-2 potassium channels in CA2, compared with other hippocampal subregions, leads to the lack of LTP. These channels produce potassium-mediated leakage currents significantly hyperpolarizing the resting membrane potential. Thus, larger depolarizing currents are required to initiate LTP. Therefore, is it necessary to look for the memory learning function of LTP in CA2? Zhao compared the expression patterns of NMDAR mRNAs in CA2 and CA3 finding that those mRNAs are expressed in both subregions. What distinguish the CA2 and the CA3? Certain \\\"memory suppressor\\\" genes (e.g., RGS14) play a key role in suppressing LTP induction (Lee et al., 2010a, 2010b, Dudek et al., 2016). More evidence suggests that the induction of NMDAR-dependent LTP and memory formation in CA2 can occur under very specific conditions (Wersinger et al., 2002, Prediger & Takahashi, 2005, DeVito et al., 2009, Caruana et al., 2012). We conclude that NMDAR-dependent LTP in the CA2 area is rare, but not impossible. Therefore, its role in CA2 needs further study.\n\nThe NMDAR-dependent LTP in CA3 is involved in learning and memory storage acquisition although NMDAR-dependent LTP in CA3 is uncommon. The fact that LTP in the Moss fiber-CA3 system coincides with the progress in learning demonstrates the role of CA3 in learning and memory. Based on electrophysiological data by Martinez et al. (2002), an associative LTP was found in the perforant pathway inputting into CA3, which means that there is NMDAR-dependent LTP between perforant pathway and the CA3 synapse. The following step is to study its function. Nakazawa et al. (2003) found that \\\"one-time learning\\\" is blocked by specific knockout of CA3 NMDAR in mice. We thus argue that NMDA-dependent LTP in CA3 plays an important role in the information acquiring and storing from new experiences. Lee & Kesner\\'s (2004) study also demonstrated that CA3 neurons are activated during recall of objects or locations. It refers that NMDA-dependent LTP in CA3 may affect object-location pairing association tasks. In hippocampal CA3, two distinct forms of LTP have been described, one of which is the classical NMDA-dependent LTP (Zalutsky and Nicoll, 1990). The disadvantage of these experiments is that we do not know whether to confirm the function of another LTP and whether it is also involved in memory and learning functions. Although these experiments do not cover all types of LTPs, at least we know that NMDAR-dependent LTP in CA3 is involved in memory acquisition.\n\nThe NMDAR-dependent LTP in DG focuses more on spatial working memory (SWM) (Active spatial information in working memory over a short period (van Asselen et al., 2006)) than spatial reference memory (SRM). Nosten-Bertrand et al. (1996) first proposed that spatial learning is not obviously blocked in the absence of a DG LTP gene anaesthetized rats, which we mentioned present in CA1. Although a subsequent study by Errington et al. (1997) speculated that this phenomenon may be due to the effect of gene knockout on inhibitory neurons. Additional evidence for this hypothesis is that massive loss of the NR1 subunit of the NMDAR only showed severely impaired LTP in the perforant pathway inputs of the DG, whereas LTP is unchanged from CA3 to CA1. Based on this study, behavioural assessments of these mice show significant SWM impairment but no effect on hippocampal-dependent SRM performance for the same task. However, other studies have demonstrated that DG selectivity, fibre-sparing, and colchicine lesions can lead to impairment of both SWM and SRM (Xavier, Oliveira-Filho & Santos, 1999). This is complemented with behavioural experiments by Jeltsch et al. (2001), where DG impairment significantly increases SRM and SWM errors in the four-from-eight radial maze task. The downside, however, is that these results fail to provide positive evidence for the hypothesis that NMDAR-mediated synaptic plasticity in the DG supports spatial pattern separation. The present results cannot completely rule out a role for the NMDAR LTP in the DG in spatial pattern separation across tasks, although it is clearly shown that any putative role must be limited to the working memory. We can argue that DG may be involved in both spatial working memory and SRM but is more focused on spatial working memory.\n\nThe biggest difference among the function of NMDAR-dependent LTP hippocampal subregions is the roles these played in spatial learning. According to earlier studies, in contrast to CA1, damages to mossy fibre to CA3 LTP (Huang et al., 1995) and perforant pathway to DG LTP (Nosten-Bertrand et al., 1996) are not associated with deficits in spatial memory. Huang et al. (1999) found that mossy fibre CA3 LTP and perforant DG LTP are dispensable for spatial learning. This is consistent with the notion that CA1 LTP is critical for spatial learning. CA1 LTPs are particularly important for spatial and contextual learning in the hippocampus compared to CA3 or DG LTPs. What is more, subsequent further studies confirmed that other subregions are also involved in learning and memory. Okada et al. (2003) examined the effect of NMDA-dependent LTP on spatial learning in rats after increasing the extent of NMDA-dependent LTP by using viral vectors for gene editing. It is demonstrated that although CA1 and the DG have similar mechanisms of LTP induction, they play distinct functional roles in spatial learning. To explore the differences in information storage capacity, Bromer et al. (2018) used a method combining signal detection theory with accurate 3D reconstruction of serial section electron microscopy to study in vivo perforant pathway LTP processes in the DG of the mature hippocampus. Bromer et al. investigate synaptic plasticity and information storage capacity. It is found that the information storage capacity of the DG is much lower than CA1. This study elucidates the temporal LTP process of storing information and the inter-regional variation of information storage capacity, that is, differences in spatial learning between CA1 and DG.\n\nThis essay focuses on the roles of NMDAR-dependent LTP in learning and memory in various hippocampal subregions. From these studies, we can conclude that the NMDA-dependent LTP in CA1 and the DG gets involved in acquiring memory that needs to be retrieved after a delay period beyond the short-term. CA1 is the basis of spatial memory formation, associating spatial learning and memory. DG also plays an important role in spatial working memory, mainly in spatial working memory. The NMDAR-dependent LTP in CA3 is significant in situations where reorganization of spatial representations memory is required. It is involved in memory acquisition as well, with a focus on spatial reference memory. The recognition of each subregion can help us understand the integral mechanism. We should consider each subregion separately but focus on the overall functional interaction. It may become an innovative point for future research. Although many computational models and anatomical studies have highlighted functional differences between NMDAR-dependent LTP in the hippocampus, the subregional heterogeneity of NMDAR function is still largely unknown. Therefore, as the technology develops, the following research on the mechanisms of NMDA-dependent LTP in each subregion and interaction are supposed to be further explored.\n\n## **Reference**\n\n1.

As early as 1949, Hebb proposed that learning and memory are stored as changes in the strength of synaptic connections between neurons. Along with the discovery of the LTP phenomenon by Bliss & Lomo (1973) and subsequent research, the hypothesis that the LTP provides a neural basis for learning and memory formation has been widely accepted by the public. The NMDAR-dependent LTP processes in the hippocampus, especially in the CA1 subregion of the hippocampus, are thought to be the neural basis for spatial learning and memory (Martin et al., 2000, Bliss & Collingridge, 1993). The hippocampus consists of four Cornu Ammonis regions (CA1 to CA4) and dentate gyrus (DG), of which CA4 can also be considered part of the DG due to the partial overlap of structure and function (Andersen et al., 2007, Anand & Dhikav, 2012). With the desire of studying hippocampal subregions, one question is proposed: how can we specifically study the subregions? The arrangement of hippocampal neurons allows the hippocampus to be sliced, leaving most of the relevant circuitry intact (Purves, Augustine & Fitzpatrick, 2001). The undamaged circuit of the individual subregions ensures the feasibility and authenticity of our study about each subregion. Thus, in-depth study of each subregion has become a hot topic in the past decades. This essay aims to discuss NMDAR-dependent LTP in different hippocampal subregions can have distinct and similar roles in learning and memory.\n\nLTP can be observed at three main excitatory synapses in the hippocampal circuit, the excitatory synaptic pathway of the hippocampus. In this circuit, the perforant pathway extends from pyramidal cells in the entorhinal area to granule cells in the DG; the mossy fibre pathway extends from granule cells in the DG to CA3 pyramidal cells; Schaffer collateral pathways from CA3 pyramidal cells to CA1 pyramidal cells (Fig 1). Bliss & Collingridge (1993), Nicoll & Malenka (1995) believe that two subregions, CA1 and DG, show NMDAR-dependent LTP. However, their findings do not imply the absence of NMDA receptor-dependent LTP in other hippocampal subregions due to the limitations in-vitro experiments. In 2002, Lee & Kesner collected some data indicating the involvement of NMDAR in CA3, which may be explained as an attractor state (a temporarily self-sustaining state), with a computational model based on physiological evidence and behavioural experiments. In this research, Lee suggested behavioural evidence for differences in NMDAR spatial working memory function among hippocampal subregions. Lee\\'s research eliminates the influence of another type of LTP with the local subregion-specific injection of NMDAR antagonists. As the participation of CA3, the role of the hippocampal NMDAR-dependent LTP might be misunderstood. However, previous research still cannot explain the role in the hippocampal subregions well. The association hypothesis between NMDAR-dependent LTP and learning and memory in hippocampal subregions require more experiments to validate. When we focus on each subregion, their distinct and similar roles in learning and memory may be revealed.\n\n![image-20220216191746673](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202202161917751.png)\n\n**Figure 1**. LTP in Schaffer collateral pathway, mossy fibre pathway and perforant pathway (Chen et al. 1997)\n\nThe CA1 subregion is the neural foundation linking spatial learning and memory. Tsien et. al (1996a, 1996b) knockout the GluN1 subunit (in NMDAR) resulting in the deficit of LTP in Schaffer collateral CA1 synapses finding the spatial reference memory is impaired in mice. This research directly proves that NMDAR-dependent LTP at CA1 synapses is the neural foundation for associative, long-term spatial memory formation. Additionally, CA1-KO mice lack NMDAR-mediated postsynaptic currents and LTP in CA1. These mice showed impaired spatial memory in the Morris hidden platform water maze, in the opposite, performed well on non-spatial learning tasks. The results provide contrastive support for the hypothesis that NMDAR-mediated LTP in the CA1 region is critical for the formation of some specific types of memory. Similarly, spatial learning deficits were reported in mice with the impaired LTP in CA1 owing to the lack of the gene encoding α subunit of calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (αCaMKII) (Silva et al., 1992a, 1992b). These mice lack spatial memory, the same as spatial memory deficits in CA1-KO mice. A possible shortcoming in this experiment is that previous experiments are based on direct injection of NMDAR antagonists into the brain, which may not be sufficiently convincing in terms of regional idiosyncrasy. According to Hestrin\\'s discovery in 1996: NMDAR contributes to synaptic transmission in some regions of the neocortex. We can conclude that memory impairment can be explained, at least in part, by deficits in the computing ability of the neocortex, rather than impairments in synaptic plasticity within the hippocampus. Subsequently, Bannerman et al. (2012) used transgenic mice lacking the GluN1 subunit and NMDARs in the pyramidal cells of CA1 and the granule cells of DG finding that the spatial reference memory of the mice acquired the radial maze task was impaired. It furtherly demonstrates the fact: hippocampal CA1 plays an important role in the learning of spatial reference memory. In 2013, it took a turn when Taylor et al. found that such mice performed well on the classic open-field spatial reference memory water maze task. How can it happen? It possibly indicates that the hippocampal NMDAR is not actually required for the formation of long-term associative spatial memory, which is against Tsien\\'s results. But Taylor does not explain this in detail, thus it cannot determine whether there are any other compensatory mechanisms for NMDA-dependent LTP. Whatever, as Niewoehner et al. (2007) argues, the development of spatially restricted genetic modifications has identified synaptic plasticity, which is a broader idea than LTP, with specific and separable roles in different hippocampal subregions. We may want to see more genetic modification experiments in this field. Despite the shortcomings of these research, the inter-experimental corroboration still demonstrates that CA1 has an irreplaceable role in associative, long-term spatial memory. We can consider CA1 LTP to be the basis of spatial memory formation.\n\nIn the CA2 subregion, NMDA-dependent LTP cannot be induced. Zhao et al. (2007) attempted to test whether synaptic stimulation could induce LTP in CA2 neurons, which is proved to induce NMDAR-dependent LTP in CA1, using a variety of approaches including perforated whole-cell patch-clamp recording. However, all results lead to that the synaptic current is not increased. One of the explanations from Caruana, Alexander, & Dudek (2012) is that the high expression of TREK-1 and TREK-2 potassium channels in CA2, compared with other hippocampal subregions, leads to the lack of LTP. These channels produce potassium-mediated leakage currents significantly hyperpolarizing the resting membrane potential. Thus, larger depolarizing currents are required to initiate LTP. Therefore, is it necessary to look for the memory learning function of LTP in CA2? Zhao compared the expression patterns of NMDAR mRNAs in CA2 and CA3 finding that those mRNAs are expressed in both subregions. What distinguish the CA2 and the CA3? Certain \\\"memory suppressor\\\" genes (e.g., RGS14) play a key role in suppressing LTP induction (Lee et al., 2010a, 2010b, Dudek et al., 2016). More evidence suggests that the induction of NMDAR-dependent LTP and memory formation in CA2 can occur under very specific conditions (Wersinger et al., 2002, Prediger & Takahashi, 2005, DeVito et al., 2009, Caruana et al., 2012). We conclude that NMDAR-dependent LTP in the CA2 area is rare, but not impossible. Therefore, its role in CA2 needs further study.\n\nThe NMDAR-dependent LTP in CA3 is involved in learning and memory storage acquisition although NMDAR-dependent LTP in CA3 is uncommon. The fact that LTP in the Moss fiber-CA3 system coincides with the progress in learning demonstrates the role of CA3 in learning and memory. Based on electrophysiological data by Martinez et al. (2002), an associative LTP was found in the perforant pathway inputting into CA3, which means that there is NMDAR-dependent LTP between perforant pathway and the CA3 synapse. The following step is to study its function. Nakazawa et al. (2003) found that \\\"one-time learning\\\" is blocked by specific knockout of CA3 NMDAR in mice. We thus argue that NMDA-dependent LTP in CA3 plays an important role in the information acquiring and storing from new experiences. Lee & Kesner\\'s (2004) study also demonstrated that CA3 neurons are activated during recall of objects or locations. It refers that NMDA-dependent LTP in CA3 may affect object-location pairing association tasks. In hippocampal CA3, two distinct forms of LTP have been described, one of which is the classical NMDA-dependent LTP (Zalutsky and Nicoll, 1990). The disadvantage of these experiments is that we do not know whether to confirm the function of another LTP and whether it is also involved in memory and learning functions. Although these experiments do not cover all types of LTPs, at least we know that NMDAR-dependent LTP in CA3 is involved in memory acquisition.\n\nThe NMDAR-dependent LTP in DG focuses more on spatial working memory (SWM) (Active spatial information in working memory over a short period (van Asselen et al., 2006)) than spatial reference memory (SRM). Nosten-Bertrand et al. (1996) first proposed that spatial learning is not obviously blocked in the absence of a DG LTP gene anaesthetized rats, which we mentioned present in CA1. Although a subsequent study by Errington et al. (1997) speculated that this phenomenon may be due to the effect of gene knockout on inhibitory neurons. Additional evidence for this hypothesis is that massive loss of the NR1 subunit of the NMDAR only showed severely impaired LTP in the perforant pathway inputs of the DG, whereas LTP is unchanged from CA3 to CA1. Based on this study, behavioural assessments of these mice show significant SWM impairment but no effect on hippocampal-dependent SRM performance for the same task. However, other studies have demonstrated that DG selectivity, fibre-sparing, and colchicine lesions can lead to impairment of both SWM and SRM (Xavier, Oliveira-Filho & Santos, 1999). This is complemented with behavioural experiments by Jeltsch et al. (2001), where DG impairment significantly increases SRM and SWM errors in the four-from-eight radial maze task. The downside, however, is that these results fail to provide positive evidence for the hypothesis that NMDAR-mediated synaptic plasticity in the DG supports spatial pattern separation. The present results cannot completely rule out a role for the NMDAR LTP in the DG in spatial pattern separation across tasks, although it is clearly shown that any putative role must be limited to the working memory. We can argue that DG may be involved in both spatial working memory and SRM but is more focused on spatial working memory.\n\nThe biggest difference among the function of NMDAR-dependent LTP hippocampal subregions is the roles these played in spatial learning. According to earlier studies, in contrast to CA1, damages to mossy fibre to CA3 LTP (Huang et al., 1995) and perforant pathway to DG LTP (Nosten-Bertrand et al., 1996) are not associated with deficits in spatial memory. Huang et al. (1999) found that mossy fibre CA3 LTP and perforant DG LTP are dispensable for spatial learning. This is consistent with the notion that CA1 LTP is critical for spatial learning. CA1 LTPs are particularly important for spatial and contextual learning in the hippocampus compared to CA3 or DG LTPs. What is more, subsequent further studies confirmed that other subregions are also involved in learning and memory. Okada et al. (2003) examined the effect of NMDA-dependent LTP on spatial learning in rats after increasing the extent of NMDA-dependent LTP by using viral vectors for gene editing. It is demonstrated that although CA1 and the DG have similar mechanisms of LTP induction, they play distinct functional roles in spatial learning. To explore the differences in information storage capacity, Bromer et al. (2018) used a method combining signal detection theory with accurate 3D reconstruction of serial section electron microscopy to study in vivo perforant pathway LTP processes in the DG of the mature hippocampus. Bromer et al. investigate synaptic plasticity and information storage capacity. It is found that the information storage capacity of the DG is much lower than CA1. This study elucidates the temporal LTP process of storing information and the inter-regional variation of information storage capacity, that is, differences in spatial learning between CA1 and DG.\n\nThis essay focuses on the roles of NMDAR-dependent LTP in learning and memory in various hippocampal subregions. From these studies, we can conclude that the NMDA-dependent LTP in CA1 and the DG gets involved in acquiring memory that needs to be retrieved after a delay period beyond the short-term. CA1 is the basis of spatial memory formation, associating spatial learning and memory. DG also plays an important role in spatial working memory, mainly in spatial working memory. The NMDAR-dependent LTP in CA3 is significant in situations where reorganization of spatial representations memory is required. It is involved in memory acquisition as well, with a focus on spatial reference memory. The recognition of each subregion can help us understand the integral mechanism. We should consider each subregion separately but focus on the overall functional interaction. It may become an innovative point for future research. Although many computational models and anatomical studies have highlighted functional differences between NMDAR-dependent LTP in the hippocampus, the subregional heterogeneity of NMDAR function is still largely unknown. Therefore, as the technology develops, the following research on the mechanisms of NMDA-dependent LTP in each subregion and interaction are supposed to be further explored.\n\n## **Reference**\n\n1.

Explain, using equations, the phenomenon of ‘Blocking’. \n\nBlocking is the phenomenon where there will be no association with the new stimulus is formed when the unconditional reflex has been predicted. It generally refers to the inability to express knowledge or skills due to failures in learning or memory. If the unconditional stimulus is already predicted fully by one stimulus, and the addition of a new stimulus does not provide any new important information about the unconditional stimuli, the unconditional stimuli will not activate or support the learning process which is responsible for establishing the new conditional reflex. Explaining the phenomenon of blocking in detail, here first come the delta law and reinforcement learning model:\n\nThe delta law model is a learning model that describes changes in the strength of synapse, such as learning the relationship between stimulus and reward, using gradient descent to find the optimal weight vector. The gradient descent method is to solve the minimum value of the function, i.e., the error, along the direction of gradient descent.\n\nClassical conditioning is a basic form of associative learning which is considered an essential component of complex learning. Typically, classical conditioning occurs when a neutral stimulus (conditional stimulus) is paired closely or consecutively temporally with a biological stimulus (unconditional stimulus) eliciting a reflex behaviour that is still unlearned (unconditional response).\n\nHere is a simple stimuli- reward model:\n\n![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202201221004405.png)\n\nIn this equation, the w is the weight ratio which is learned with the delta rule from the association of stimulus and reward. It is a vector, which means that its direction can be changed as the stimulus changes. This directionality is necessary for the presence of multiple stimuli. The u is the presence or absence of a stimulus, which takes a binary value between 0 and 1, that is, u is 1 if there is a stimulus, and u is 0 if there is no stimulus.\n\n![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202201221005012.png)\n\nHere δ is the predictive error for a given stimulus and reward, which can be predicted by the following equation:\n\n![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202201221005829.png)\n\nHere the ε defines a learning rate, i.e., how fast shall we update the association between the stimulus and reward, this value is between 0 and 1.

Explain, using equations, the phenomenon of ‘Blocking’. \n\nBlocking is the phenomenon where there will be no association with the new stimulus is formed when the unconditional reflex has been predicted. It generally refers to the inability to express knowledge or skills due to failures in learning or memory. If the unconditional stimulus is already predicted fully by one stimulus, and the addition of a new stimulus does not provide any new important information about the unconditional stimuli, the unconditional stimuli will not activate or support the learning process which is responsible for establishing the new conditional reflex. Explaining the phenomenon of blocking in detail, here first come the delta law and reinforcement learning model:\n\nThe delta law model is a learning model that describes changes in the strength of synapse, such as learning the relationship between stimulus and reward, using gradient descent to find the optimal weight vector. The gradient descent method is to solve the minimum value of the function, i.e., the error, along the direction of gradient descent.\n\nClassical conditioning is a basic form of associative learning which is considered an essential component of complex learning. Typically, classical conditioning occurs when a neutral stimulus (conditional stimulus) is paired closely or consecutively temporally with a biological stimulus (unconditional stimulus) eliciting a reflex behaviour that is still unlearned (unconditional response).\n\nHere is a simple stimuli- reward model:\n\n![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202201221004405.png)\n\nIn this equation, the w is the weight ratio which is learned with the delta rule from the association of stimulus and reward. It is a vector, which means that its direction can be changed as the stimulus changes. This directionality is necessary for the presence of multiple stimuli. The u is the presence or absence of a stimulus, which takes a binary value between 0 and 1, that is, u is 1 if there is a stimulus, and u is 0 if there is no stimulus.\n\n![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202201221005012.png)\n\nHere δ is the predictive error for a given stimulus and reward, which can be predicted by the following equation:\n\n![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202201221005829.png)\n\nHere the ε defines a learning rate, i.e., how fast shall we update the association between the stimulus and reward, this value is between 0 and 1. If ε is 0, it means there is no learning, thus this stimulus-reward association model is locked, and the association between stimulus and reward is not updated with any subsequent learning. If ε = 1 means that the association between stimulus and reward will change completely after one learning, this learning model is also generally meaningless for prediction. Usually, this learning rate is individually dependent and different in various conditions. Through this equation, we can predict the efficiency of learning.

The earliest written record is that Aristotle (384 to 322 BC) and Erasistratus (304 to 258 BC), two early Greek physician-scientists conducted experiments on animals (Cohen and Loew 1984). In recent years, there is some new archaeological evidence to suggest that humans tried to operate a Neolithic surgery performing trepanation on a cow in 3400-3000 BCE (Ramirez and Froment, 2018). No matter what the behind meaning is, this action may be regarded as the first attempt at animal experiments in human history. When it comes to the modern era, as model biology rides on the locomotive of the rapid development of modern science, model animals become an essential topic in biology. August Krogh (1929), the 1920 Nobel Laureate in Physiology and Medicine, famously and succinctly articulated the selection of a model of a naturally occurring species, often known as the comparative approach: “For a large number of problems there will be some animal of choice or a few such animals on which it can be (most) conveniently studied”. Nowadays, the textbook definition of an animal model “as a living organism with an inherited, naturally acquired, or induced disease state that in one or more ways closely mimics the same phenomenon existing in man\" has affected how researchers approach animal models (Wessler, 1976).\n\nFor neuroscience, several factors are supposed to be considered during selecting a model species. The criteria are stated by Davidson et al. (1987) as followed 9 points: 1) suitability as an analogue, 2) information transferability, 3) genetic uniformity, 4) biological background, 5) expense and accessibility, 6) generalizability for an outcome, 7) usability and adaptability of experimental manipulation, 8) environmental status, 9) moral involvement. Considering these criteria, model selection is mostly a matter of personal preference for individual scientists, who must then persuade the rest of the research world that their choice is sound.  Many model animals, such as drosophila, zebrafish, and mice, share physiological, behavioural, and other features with humans, according to modern science. However, these rules have not treated model animals in many details. As far as Wright was concerned in 2002, the goal of an animal model specifies the requirements that it must meet in order to be considered legitimate. As a result, to decide the weights allocated to the different evaluation criteria, any model evaluation approach must consider the goals and needs that a model is designed to meet, as well as the questions it is anticipated to answer. Meanwhile, some argue that specific research should be conducted on intact, live organisms with as little experimental manipulation as feasible to avoid experimenter-induced artefact (Dow, 2007). Otherwise, the experiment, like Schrödinger's cat (Schrödinger, 1935), will undermine the validity of the outcome. In 2009, a more systemic approach (fig 1) was put forward by van der Staay et. al. At the beginning, an ethical question must be asked: whether it is acceptable? The model evaluation process continues with the question of whether the data generated by the model is reliable and repeatable, implying that deficiencies must be reproducible and behavioural dysfunctions must be quantified using reliable procedures. The model's face validity, construct validity is then discussed. After that, if the proposed model has predictive validity becomes another problem to be concerned. All these above validities reach requirements, external validity and generalizability of the model is the final step in the model evaluation cycle. Those standards are important, but as we mentioned before, each independent experiment requires various models. Therefore, we are going to discuss 3 general model animals, mice, zebrafish and drosophila as follows.\n\nIn the past decades, a lot of different types of model animals meeting these criteria were proposed and applied, some of which decay while others show strong vitality. PubMed search results by publication on the date (Fig 2) shows that the mice continue to be the powerhouse for bioscience. The other two model animals have also been used thousands of times. The very first reason why they can be the most common model animals is that they are all affordable, usability and adaptability. There is no doubt that the most significant shift in the last decades has been the dramatic increase in the use of mice in research (McCammon, 2015). Eckardt et al. (2011) argued that the mouse appears to be the most prevalent genetically altered animal model for studying novel therapeutic compounds for various illnesses at the moment, for the following reasons. As for genome conservation, 99 per cent of human genes have homologues in mice (Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium et al., 2002). Therefore, generalizability for the outcome is doubtless accessible. The use of mouse models to evaluate pharmacological targets and develop effective and safe dose schemes for combination therapies in humans has proven successful. These scenarios all have one thing in common: they don't seek out to fully simulate a disease or disease mechanisms, but rather to gather relevant functional data. In this case, rough modelling refers to an efficient method. As for new models involving the mouse, pathological processes in human-mouse chimaeras can be uncovered by combining cellular and whole-animal techniques. To create human and mouse hybrids, human iPSCs are injected into blastula of a mouse, or tissue from human is implanted into immune-deficient mice that are older (Eckardt et al., 2011). Due to evolutionary similarities and historical reasons, mice are estimated to be the most used species to model human diseases and many other diseases. However, it is not possible to fully replicate all symptoms for one certain strain. The details are also very important when doing experiments, which is why there are specific protocols.\n\nThe mouse is a good model animal with many advantages; however, it is not the only solution or the best choice for some questions. Both the basic macro-organization of the brain and cellular morphology are strikingly comparable in zebrafish and mammalian models, the mouse for example (Kalueff, Stewart & Gerlai, 2014). The intermediate complexity of Danio rerio makes it appropriate for brain study and drug testing. It has a genetic structure that is similar to primates and a physiology that is comparable to mammals. A genetically tractable species with a sequenced genome and a broad toolset for genetic alteration, the zebrafish, like a drosophila. (Elena, 2018). The genomes of zebrafish and mammals are highly similar, with the zebrafish genome containing more than 80% of human disease genes (Howe et al., 2013). McCammon (2015) holds the view that the zebrafish is a human-like animal model that blends experimental tractability with conservation. They are quite inexpensive to keep and maintain, and they generate a high number of embryos. A considerable standard of molecular, cellular, morphological, and developmental conservation, fast temporary hereditary tests, ability for editing gene, imaging of living organism, behaviours with characteristics, multiple-diseases research, and suitability for identifying putative medicines of chemical screening    are among the zebrafish's significant attributes for addressing psychiatric disorders. The zebrafish is an excellent model organism for studying the neurological underpinnings of natural behaviour. This has been made possible by a number of technologies, including new advances in animal monitoring, computational analysis of behaviour, functional imaging of the whole brain, and methods for specific circuits and genetic manipulation. (Orger and De Polavieja 2017). In conclusion, zebrafish genetics is best adapted to large amount transient analyses, especially variant analysis and genetic interactions. However, there are also substantial disadvantages to using zebrafish models in the neuroscience research. Even though combining chemical substances with water is a simple way to do pharmacological manipulations, Chemicals can be quickly metabolized through skin and gills, based on the surface area of a particular fish and gill activity, therefore such experiments couldn't appropriately manage the medication amount taken (Rubinstein, 2006). Furthermore, from the results from Chatterjee and Gerlai (2009), zebrafish pharmacokinetic studies are still limited, and the amount of drug that reaches different target tissues is poorly explored, despite the fact that its presence and amount in the CNS can be confirmed using various chemo-analytical methods such as mass spectroscopy or high-performance liquid chromatography. The above reasons are partly why we introduce an insect as follows.\n\nThere is a smaller and simpler model animal that can be competent for a job the above two animals can't replace. Drosophila melanogaster, a well-known model animal, was famous for the finding of the concept of heritable qualities being carried on chromosomes, as well as many other ground-breaking genetic findings (Morgan 1911). The genome of drosophila was sequenced as the first main for the first time in the modern era (Adams et al., 2000). But why is drosophila a suitable model for neuroscience? Elena et al. (2018) suggest that many of these species are excellent models for understanding the cellular circuits underlying behaviour and physiology, neurotransmission, sensory perception, and plasticity, as well as the cellular basis of learning and memory at the level of the individual cell, due to the simpler organisation of the invertebrate nervous system and the presence of many accessible neurons of surprisingly large sizes at landmark locations throughout the central nervous system. Another benefit of using drosophila as a model is that the life cycle of the fly is quite short. In 10 to 12 days at 25°C, a single viable mating pair can generate hundreds of genetically identical offspring. This is in contrast to standard mouse models, which generate just a few offspring every three to four months (Pandey, 2011). At the gene level, the fly has a number of distinguishing characteristics that make it an appealing model to examine. The genome of drosophila is entirely sequenced and annotated, which encodes for more than 14,000 genes on totally four chromosomes, with three of four carrying the majority of the genome. Almost 75 per cent of genes linked to disease in humans have functioning orthologs in the drosophila, according to estimates (Reiter et al., 2001). Of course, when transferring proteins like A-beta or alpha-synuclein to fruit flies to build a disease model, someone will question: if you transfer a protein that this organism does not have originally at all, there may be some symptoms. But what is the point and whether it is meaningful or not? Moreover, the evolutionary difference between this kind of creature and human beings is too far regarding the rodent. Based on this statement, it is generally believed that the drosophila is suitable for large-scale screening, for instance, RNAi or EMS mutagenesis belonging to reverse or forward screen and the existing resources are abundant. (Pandey 2011) Experiments such as imaging behaviour are easy to operate and easy to raise. There is a big gap, but at least the targets that are worthy of in-depth selection can be screened out in the early stage. However, with the emergence of new technologies such as RNAi in mice (Slobodan 2013), these advantages may gradually weaken, but it is undeniable that some people still make models of such small animals.\n\nAll in all, these model animals do a firm favourite to the development of neuroscience. On the other hand, the contributions to this issue show that a range of less common and, at times, more specialised animal model systems are used to make numerous breakthroughs in neuroscience. Our understanding of evolutionarily conserved core processes and adaptive solutions that are basic to CNS function across phyla has improved thanks to research employing this diverse set of models (Elena 2018). Advances in stimulus delivery, behavioural monitoring, and the measurement and modulation of brain activity have made model animals behaviour more accurate and experimentally accessible in naturalistic settings. The rapid pace of research in this area should result in more quantitative modelling approaches, a better understanding of behaviour ontogeny, and better optical tools, making mice, zebrafish and drosophila an appealing system not only for genetics and development research but also for investigating the neural circuit basis of complex behaviours (Orger and De Polavieja 2017). In neuroscience research, model animals will add a rich and colourful stroke to the annals of history. The next century will be illuminated as more and more new animal models are being designed and put into use. The building of biology is waiting for us to add bricks and mortar. Zebrafish is an ideal species to study the neurobiological basis of natural behaviour.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n## Figures and Tables\n\n![oKaJMD.png](https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/11/29/oKaJMD.png)\n\n**Figure 1.** assessment for animal models with moral and scientific assessment standards (van der Staay, 2009)\n\n\n\n \n\n![oKadII.png](https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/11/29/oKadII.png)\n\n**Figure 2.** PubMed results by publication indexed on the date, 1950 through 2020.

Nowadays, the textbook definition of an animal model “as a living organism with an inherited, naturally acquired, or induced disease state that in one or more ways closely mimics the same phenomenon existing in man\" has affected how researchers approach animal models (Wessler, 1976).\n\nFor neuroscience, several factors are supposed to be considered during selecting a model species. The criteria are stated by Davidson et al. (1987) as followed 9 points: 1) suitability as an analogue, 2) information transferability, 3) genetic uniformity, 4) biological background, 5) expense and accessibility, 6) generalizability for an outcome, 7) usability and adaptability of experimental manipulation, 8) environmental status, 9) moral involvement. Considering these criteria, model selection is mostly a matter of personal preference for individual scientists, who must then persuade the rest of the research world that their choice is sound.  Many model animals, such as drosophila, zebrafish, and mice, share physiological, behavioural, and other features with humans, according to modern science. However, these rules have not treated model animals in many details. As far as Wright was concerned in 2002, the goal of an animal model specifies the requirements that it must meet in order to be considered legitimate. As a result, to decide the weights allocated to the different evaluation criteria, any model evaluation approach must consider the goals and needs that a model is designed to meet, as well as the questions it is anticipated to answer. Meanwhile, some argue that specific research should be conducted on intact, live organisms with as little experimental manipulation as feasible to avoid experimenter-induced artefact (Dow, 2007). Otherwise, the experiment, like Schrödinger's cat (Schrödinger, 1935), will undermine the validity of the outcome. In 2009, a more systemic approach (fig 1) was put forward by van der Staay et. al. At the beginning, an ethical question must be asked: whether it is acceptable? The model evaluation process continues with the question of whether the data generated by the model is reliable and repeatable, implying that deficiencies must be reproducible and behavioural dysfunctions must be quantified using reliable procedures. The model's face validity, construct validity is then discussed. After that, if the proposed model has predictive validity becomes another problem to be concerned. All these above validities reach requirements, external validity and generalizability of the model is the final step in the model evaluation cycle. Those standards are important, but as we mentioned before, each independent experiment requires various models. Therefore, we are going to discuss 3 general model animals, mice, zebrafish and drosophila as follows.\n\nIn the past decades, a lot of different types of model animals meeting these criteria were proposed and applied, some of which decay while others show strong vitality. PubMed search results by publication on the date (Fig 2) shows that the mice continue to be the powerhouse for bioscience. The other two model animals have also been used thousands of times. The very first reason why they can be the most common model animals is that they are all affordable, usability and adaptability. There is no doubt that the most significant shift in the last decades has been the dramatic increase in the use of mice in research (McCammon, 2015). Eckardt et al. (2011) argued that the mouse appears to be the most prevalent genetically altered animal model for studying novel therapeutic compounds for various illnesses at the moment, for the following reasons. As for genome conservation, 99 per cent of human genes have homologues in mice (Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium et al., 2002). Therefore, generalizability for the outcome is doubtless accessible. The use of mouse models to evaluate pharmacological targets and develop effective and safe dose schemes for combination therapies in humans has proven successful. These scenarios all have one thing in common: they don't seek out to fully simulate a disease or disease mechanisms, but rather to gather relevant functional data. In this case, rough modelling refers to an efficient method. As for new models involving the mouse, pathological processes in human-mouse chimaeras can be uncovered by combining cellular and whole-animal techniques. To create human and mouse hybrids, human iPSCs are injected into blastula of a mouse, or tissue from human is implanted into immune-deficient mice that are older (Eckardt et al., 2011). Due to evolutionary similarities and historical reasons, mice are estimated to be the most used species to model human diseases and many other diseases. However, it is not possible to fully replicate all symptoms for one certain strain. The details are also very important when doing experiments, which is why there are specific protocols.\n\nThe mouse is a good model animal with many advantages; however, it is not the only solution or the best choice for some questions. Both the basic macro-organization of the brain and cellular morphology are strikingly comparable in zebrafish and mammalian models, the mouse for example (Kalueff, Stewart & Gerlai, 2014). The intermediate complexity of Danio rerio makes it appropriate for brain study and drug testing. It has a genetic structure that is similar to primates and a physiology that is comparable to mammals. A genetically tractable species with a sequenced genome and a broad toolset for genetic alteration, the zebrafish, like a drosophila. (Elena, 2018). The genomes of zebrafish and mammals are highly similar, with the zebrafish genome containing more than 80% of human disease genes (Howe et al., 2013). McCammon (2015) holds the view that the zebrafish is a human-like animal model that blends experimental tractability with conservation. They are quite inexpensive to keep and maintain, and they generate a high number of embryos. A considerable standard of molecular, cellular, morphological, and developmental conservation, fast temporary hereditary tests, ability for editing gene, imaging of living organism, behaviours with characteristics, multiple-diseases research, and suitability for identifying putative medicines of chemical screening    are among the zebrafish's significant attributes for addressing psychiatric disorders. The zebrafish is an excellent model organism for studying the neurological underpinnings of natural behaviour. This has been made possible by a number of technologies, including new advances in animal monitoring, computational analysis of behaviour, functional imaging of the whole brain, and methods for specific circuits and genetic manipulation. (Orger and De Polavieja 2017). In conclusion, zebrafish genetics is best adapted to large amount transient analyses, especially variant analysis and genetic interactions. However, there are also substantial disadvantages to using zebrafish models in the neuroscience research. Even though combining chemical substances with water is a simple way to do pharmacological manipulations, Chemicals can be quickly metabolized through skin and gills, based on the surface area of a particular fish and gill activity, therefore such experiments couldn't appropriately manage the medication amount taken (Rubinstein, 2006). Furthermore, from the results from Chatterjee and Gerlai (2009), zebrafish pharmacokinetic studies are still limited, and the amount of drug that reaches different target tissues is poorly explored, despite the fact that its presence and amount in the CNS can be confirmed using various chemo-analytical methods such as mass spectroscopy or high-performance liquid chromatography. The above reasons are partly why we introduce an insect as follows.\n\nThere is a smaller and simpler model animal that can be competent for a job the above two animals can't replace. Drosophila melanogaster, a well-known model animal, was famous for the finding of the concept of heritable qualities being carried on chromosomes, as well as many other ground-breaking genetic findings (Morgan 1911). The genome of drosophila was sequenced as the first main for the first time in the modern era (Adams et al., 2000). But why is drosophila a suitable model for neuroscience? Elena et al. (2018) suggest that many of these species are excellent models for understanding the cellular circuits underlying behaviour and physiology, neurotransmission, sensory perception, and plasticity, as well as the cellular basis of learning and memory at the level of the individual cell, due to the simpler organisation of the invertebrate nervous system and the presence of many accessible neurons of surprisingly large sizes at landmark locations throughout the central nervous system. Another benefit of using drosophila as a model is that the life cycle of the fly is quite short. In 10 to 12 days at 25°C, a single viable mating pair can generate hundreds of genetically identical offspring. This is in contrast to standard mouse models, which generate just a few offspring every three to four months (Pandey, 2011). At the gene level, the fly has a number of distinguishing characteristics that make it an appealing model to examine. The genome of drosophila is entirely sequenced and annotated, which encodes for more than 14,000 genes on totally four chromosomes, with three of four carrying the majority of the genome. Almost 75 per cent of genes linked to disease in humans have functioning orthologs in the drosophila, according to estimates (Reiter et al., 2001). Of course, when transferring proteins like A-beta or alpha-synuclein to fruit flies to build a disease model, someone will question: if you transfer a protein that this organism does not have originally at all, there may be some symptoms. But what is the point and whether it is meaningful or not? Moreover, the evolutionary difference between this kind of creature and human beings is too far regarding the rodent. Based on this statement, it is generally believed that the drosophila is suitable for large-scale screening, for instance, RNAi or EMS mutagenesis belonging to reverse or forward screen and the existing resources are abundant. (Pandey 2011) Experiments such as imaging behaviour are easy to operate and easy to raise. There is a big gap, but at least the targets that are worthy of in-depth selection can be screened out in the early stage. However, with the emergence of new technologies such as RNAi in mice (Slobodan 2013), these advantages may gradually weaken, but it is undeniable that some people still make models of such small animals.\n\nAll in all, these model animals do a firm favourite to the development of neuroscience. On the other hand, the contributions to this issue show that a range of less common and, at times, more specialised animal model systems are used to make numerous breakthroughs in neuroscience. Our understanding of evolutionarily conserved core processes and adaptive solutions that are basic to CNS function across phyla has improved thanks to research employing this diverse set of models (Elena 2018). Advances in stimulus delivery, behavioural monitoring, and the measurement and modulation of brain activity have made model animals behaviour more accurate and experimentally accessible in naturalistic settings. The rapid pace of research in this area should result in more quantitative modelling approaches, a better understanding of behaviour ontogeny, and better optical tools, making mice, zebrafish and drosophila an appealing system not only for genetics and development research but also for investigating the neural circuit basis of complex behaviours (Orger and De Polavieja 2017). In neuroscience research, model animals will add a rich and colourful stroke to the annals of history. The next century will be illuminated as more and more new animal models are being designed and put into use. The building of biology is waiting for us to add bricks and mortar. Zebrafish is an ideal species to study the neurobiological basis of natural behaviour.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n## Figures and Tables\n\n![oKaJMD.png](https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/11/29/oKaJMD.png)\n\n**Figure 1.** assessment for animal models with moral and scientific assessment standards (van der Staay, 2009)\n\n\n\n \n\n![oKadII.png](https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/11/29/oKadII.png)\n\n**Figure 2.** PubMed results by publication indexed on the date, 1950 through 2020.

The dynamic process of a lens’ morphological transformation is caused by the changes in the radius of the ciliary muscle (Helmholtz 1909), during which the curving covering diameters of the lens on both sides reduce, resulting in a raising power of refraction (Glasser 2006), then the lens will be accommodated (Figure 1).\n\n![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202202171345007.gif)\n\n**Figure 1.** Contraction of the ciliary muscle results to an accommodation (Land 2005)\n\n \n\n**Blind spot:** The blind spot is a small region in the field of vision correlating to the location of the optic disc (Figure 2) without image detection (Gamm, Albert & Daniel 2020), from which is the cranial nerve II penetrates so that there are no photoreceptors in the optic disc (Ramachandran 1992). \n\n![Find Your Blind Spot!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202202171346685.jpg)\n\n**Figure 2.** Location of blind spot (Lohner 2020).\n\n\n\n**Cones and rods:** Cones and rods are the two kinds of photoreceptors (Figure 3) in the retina of the vertebrate retina (Schwiegerling 2004). The cones show responsibility to the bright light and colour sensitivity while cones are responsible for dim light (Schultze M 1866).\n\n![Differentiation between Cones and Rods (Ingram et al.2016)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202202171348845.gif)\n\n**Figure 3.** Differentiation between Cones and Rods (Ingram et al. 2016)\n\n\n\n**Directionally selective ganglion cells:** Directionally selective ganglion cells are a group of retinal ganglion cells that can detect motions in different directions. They can respond actively to a movement from the chosen direction with a high postsynaptic potential after an inhibitory spike (Borst 2011) while active infrequently in response to opposite-direction movement of the same item (Barlow 1963). \n\n\n\n**Fovea Centralis:** Fovea Centralis is a tiny fossa in the centre of eyes (Figure 4) composed of cones densely located in the middle of the macula lutea (Iwasaki & Inomata 1986). Foveal vision is functioned by this area and is responsible for distinct item characteristics, such as form and location (Lettvin 1976).\n\n![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202202171350909.jpg)\n\n**Figure 4.** Fovea centralis anatomy in human eyes\n\n  \n\n**Photopigment:**  Photopigment is a transmembrane protein held inside photoreceptors functioning for light perception situated in plates of film in the external fragment of a pole or cone (Fu 2010). The purpose is to absorb incident light and afterwards produce a cascade reaction to change the electrical characters of the photoreceptors, in which case trigger the release of glutamate (Hart 2009). \n\n\n\n**Photoreception:** Photoreception is a process that photoreceptors for instance cones and rods retain light waves which are captured by eyes then convert the electromagnetic signs into electrochemical signs which are then shipped off the cerebrum for visual handling invertebrate animals (Foster et al. 1991). The whole process converts light stimulus to nerve impulse at last with help from specialised photoreceptors in the retina.\n\n \n\n**Phototransduction:** Phototransduction is an interaction by which electromagnetic energy is changed over into electrical chemical energy in cone cells, rod cells and retinal photosensitive ganglion cells in the eyes (Kusakabe et al. 2009). This process includes a series of primary biochemical and physiological actions, which is also known as “Wald's Visual Cycle” (Figure 5).\n\n![4: Wald&#39;s visual cycle.

It is a photoreceptor and glial cells layer that catches approaching photons and sends them along neuronal pathways as both electrical and synthetic signs (Nguyen et al. 2021).\n\n \n\n![Illustration of retina anatomy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202202171351226.jpg)\n\n**Figure 6.** Retina anatomy (Heiting 2019)\n\n\n\n**Rhodopsin:** Rhodopsin is a kind of light-sensitive G-protein coupled receptor protein (GPCR) (Figure 7) (Lenaan et al. 2020) functioning during vision Wald's visual cycle. As a photo switchable opsin, one kind of photopigment found in retinal rods, it can be activated in a very low light environment (Litmann 1996).\n\n![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202202171352248.gif)\n\n**Figure 7.** 3D view of rhodopsin model (1F88)\n\n \n\n## **References:**\n\nHelmholtz, H. & Southall, J.

The dynamic process of a lens’ morphological transformation is caused by the changes in the radius of the ciliary muscle (Helmholtz 1909), during which the curving covering diameters of the lens on both sides reduce, resulting in a raising power of refraction (Glasser 2006), then the lens will be accommodated (Figure 1).\n\n![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202202171345007.gif)\n\n**Figure 1.** Contraction of the ciliary muscle results to an accommodation (Land 2005)\n\n \n\n**Blind spot:** The blind spot is a small region in the field of vision correlating to the location of the optic disc (Figure 2) without image detection (Gamm, Albert & Daniel 2020), from which is the cranial nerve II penetrates so that there are no photoreceptors in the optic disc (Ramachandran 1992). \n\n![Find Your Blind Spot!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202202171346685.jpg)\n\n**Figure 2.** Location of blind spot (Lohner 2020).\n\n\n\n**Cones and rods:** Cones and rods are the two kinds of photoreceptors (Figure 3) in the retina of the vertebrate retina (Schwiegerling 2004). The cones show responsibility to the bright light and colour sensitivity while cones are responsible for dim light (Schultze M 1866).\n\n![Differentiation between Cones and Rods (Ingram et al.2016)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202202171348845.gif)\n\n**Figure 3.** Differentiation between Cones and Rods (Ingram et al. 2016)\n\n\n\n**Directionally selective ganglion cells:** Directionally selective ganglion cells are a group of retinal ganglion cells that can detect motions in different directions. They can respond actively to a movement from the chosen direction with a high postsynaptic potential after an inhibitory spike (Borst 2011) while active infrequently in response to opposite-direction movement of the same item (Barlow 1963). \n\n\n\n**Fovea Centralis:** Fovea Centralis is a tiny fossa in the centre of eyes (Figure 4) composed of cones densely located in the middle of the macula lutea (Iwasaki & Inomata 1986). Foveal vision is functioned by this area and is responsible for distinct item characteristics, such as form and location (Lettvin 1976).\n\n![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202202171350909.jpg)\n\n**Figure 4.** Fovea centralis anatomy in human eyes\n\n  \n\n**Photopigment:**  Photopigment is a transmembrane protein held inside photoreceptors functioning for light perception situated in plates of film in the external fragment of a pole or cone (Fu 2010). The purpose is to absorb incident light and afterwards produce a cascade reaction to change the electrical characters of the photoreceptors, in which case trigger the release of glutamate (Hart 2009). \n\n\n\n**Photoreception:** Photoreception is a process that photoreceptors for instance cones and rods retain light waves which are captured by eyes then convert the electromagnetic signs into electrochemical signs which are then shipped off the cerebrum for visual handling invertebrate animals (Foster et al. 1991). The whole process converts light stimulus to nerve impulse at last with help from specialised photoreceptors in the retina.\n\n \n\n**Phototransduction:** Phototransduction is an interaction by which electromagnetic energy is changed over into electrical chemical energy in cone cells, rod cells and retinal photosensitive ganglion cells in the eyes (Kusakabe et al. 2009). This process includes a series of primary biochemical and physiological actions, which is also known as “Wald's Visual Cycle” (Figure 5).\n\n![4: Wald&#39;s visual cycle. Blue color represents reactions in... | Download  Scientific Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202202171351871.jpg)\n\n**Figure 5.** Wald's Visual Cycle (Vasudevan et al. 2017)\n\n \n\n**Retina:** The retina is the inverted tissue component toward the rear of the eyes (Figure 6) that detects light after cones and rods and sends processed information to the cerebrum. It is a photoreceptor and glial cells layer that catches approaching photons and sends them along neuronal pathways as both electrical and synthetic signs (Nguyen et al. 2021).\n\n \n\n![Illustration of retina anatomy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202202171351226.jpg)\n\n**Figure 6.** Retina anatomy (Heiting 2019)\n\n\n\n**Rhodopsin:** Rhodopsin is a kind of light-sensitive G-protein coupled receptor protein (GPCR) (Figure 7) (Lenaan et al. 2020) functioning during vision Wald's visual cycle. As a photo switchable opsin, one kind of photopigment found in retinal rods, it can be activated in a very low light environment (Litmann 1996).\n\n![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202202171352248.gif)\n\n**Figure 7.** 3D view of rhodopsin model (1F88)\n\n \n\n## **References:**\n\nHelmholtz, H. & Southall, J.

In the clinical situation, tools to distinguish different diseases or states are required. However, classic classification methods have obvious shortcomings: traditional clinical categorical methods may not be competent for behaviour prediction or brain state classification and traditional machine learning models are improvable in classification accuracy. With the increasing use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) in neuroimaging computer-assisted classification, an ensemble classifier of CNNs might be able to mine hidden patterns from MEG signals. However, developing an effective brain state classifier is a difficult task owing to the non-Euclidean graphical nature of magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals.\n\nObjective: This project had two aims: 1) to develop a CNN-based model with better performance in classification than traditional machine learning models; 2) to test if the model can be improved with extra information adding relative power spectrum.\n\nMethods: To address this brain state classification modelling issue, I used MEG signals from 28 participants viewing 14 image stimuli to train the CNN. The CNN subsequently underwent 10-fold cross-validation to ensure proper classification of MEG. I also extracted the relative power spectrum and provided this to the network. The following main techniques were applied in this research, principal component analysis (PCA), convolutional block spatial and temporal features extracting modules, convolutional block attention module (CBAM) techniques, relative power spectrum (RPS) techniques, fully connected (FC) techniques.\n\nResults: In this research, my method was applied to the MEG dataset, the average classification accuracy is 23.07%±7.69%, which is much better than the baseline models: LSTM RNN model 15.38% (p = 6.8 × 10 ^--2^) and simple image classification CNN model 11.53% (p = 5.9 × 10 ^--2^). Relative power spectrum information (mainly beta and delta during this task) successfully informed the model improving its performance.\n\nConclusion: These results demonstrate that my method is feasible for the analysis and classification of brain states. It may help researchers diagnose people in the clinical situations and inform future neurological classification approaches in regard to higher specificity in identifying brain states.\n\n# Introduction\n\n## Machine learning in medical utilisation\n\nSince Donald Hebb first composed the cell assembly theory stating the consistency between neuronal activity and cognitive processes (Brown & Milner, 2003; Shaw, 1986), the idea of neural networks started to stand out in public visibility. Until Frank Rosenblatt first developed and explored the basic ingredients of deep learning (DL) (Tappert, 2019), the only constraint that can slow our steps are applications of math methods. The last past decades have seen the quick and great revolution of artificial intelligence as the development of computer science. What the big breakthrough takes us close to the scientific field are the powerful tools that teach machines to learn about the physical world. Even though machine learning techniques have gradually built their presence in recent decades, the application in medical utilisation lags.\n\nIn the past centuries, neuroscientists have always been attempting to classify and predict the brain's response to the visual world. Recently, with the rapid emergence of novel non-invasive techniques such as magnetoencephalography (MEG), electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), neuroscientists start to use these tools to solve the historical conundrum; and have made huge progress in the visual perceptual decoding or so-called \"brain-reading\" field (W. Huang et al., 2020). Each individual conscious experience is associated with a unique brain activity pattern so that it can be regarded as a fingerprint of specific brain activity. It is theoretically viable to read out one's current idea with a specifically designed computer vision and neuroimaging pattern (Haynes, 2012). In this case, it might be possible that these \"brain-reading\" techniques can tell us that could be helpful with regard to clinical applications. Nowadays, many neural mechanisms have been elucidated. Although the current studies are mostly on a reflective proof of concept track (Hedderich & Eickhoff, 2021), it is promising that these approaches will pave the way and build a solid foundation in regard to clinical applications. In contrast to the classic understanding of some mental mechanisms, more and more researchers believe that traditional categories systems may twist the real cause of diseases or behaviours (Bzdok & Meyer-Lindenberg, 2018). To fill this gap, deep learning techniques have been introduced into disease diagnosis and classification. It can avoid being affected by people's opinion bias but conversely get feedback from people so as to improve its learning ability from existing experience (Currie et al., 2019). Apart from disease classification, it is more profound to study human brain states under different conditions. Further studying of future state simulation has properly gained attention, especially on episodic future thought: the ability to rehearse events in mind, which may be going to happen in one's life trajectory (Schacter et al., 2017; Szpunar, 2010).\n\n## Aversive state reactivation and replay\n\nThe aversive state is critical for harm avoidance, playing a vital role in wilderness survival and social life (Terranova et al., 2022). As part of the aversive state, the observational fear process promotes one's capability of showing empathic fear when seeing other's aversive situations. This process may benefit from the neural replay and reactivation of individuals. The process that current state simulation reinforces the existing memory network is called \"reactivation\" while the neural activity activation is named \"neural replay\". The reactivation is based on past experience and in turn, promotes the storage of it, as well as facilitating the planning, inference and reward values updating (Wimmer & Shohamy, 2012; Wise et al., 2021). As mentioned in the previous section, one way to look at future thought simulation is to investigate memory reactivation.\n\nRecent works have shown that neural replay and reactivation are prior important in avoidance behaviour (Wu et al., 2017), which may provide individuals with a prospective prediction based on the possible consequence simulation (Doll et al., 2015). Since then, it is known \"which\" correlates to the aversive state, the following step is figuring out to what extent neuronal activity is associated with behaviour. Naturally, it encourages researchers to try predicting one's avoidance behaviour with the neuroimaging data recording. In recent years, more and more studies start to use neuroimaging classification to look for the inner mechanisms of brain states' reactivation (Belal et al., 2018; Eichenlaub et al., 2020; Roscow et al., 2021). If we want to look at memory reactivation, what we need is really good decoding methods with neuroimaging data recordings. So, it's important to optimise existing decoding methods as far as possible, which will set the scene for future related work.\n\n## Magnetoencephalography \n\nMagnetoencephalography (MEG) is useful for detecting brain states and evaluating the behavioural response. It allows us to map and locate specific brain areas and ongoing functions (Bunge & Kahn, 2009). The principle of MEG is based on magnetic induction. It is widely known that when neurons are activated, electrical signals will be generated synchronously. According to the magnetic induction principle, when the electrical fields change, secondary magnetic fields are generated. The brain-evoked magnetic field strength is usually in the range of femto-tesla to pico-tesla, i.e., 10--15 to 10-12 tesla (Singh, 2014). With the precise MEG device and mathematical preprocessing methods, these tiny signals are able to be separated from the noise and collected. MEG records magnetic fields, from which can be inferred changes in the transmission of postsynaptic current between cortical neurons.\n\nCompared to other neuroimaging methods, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has high spatial resolution but a low temporal resolution (Dash, Sao, et al., 2019); electroencephalography (EEG) records the electrical field that may twist between skin and skull, and EEG is based to reference point location hence it is sensitive to small measurement error. Electrocorticography (ECoG) is an invasive method, so it is not suitable for healthy participants and some patients; MEG stands out for its higher spatial, temporal resolution and dynamic time sequentiality. At the same time, MEG, as a non-invasive method, has its specific advantage: low preparation time, which supports a possibility for most clinical conditions. Furthermore, as novel portable MEG devices come out, it creates opportunity for various ages participants and patients (Boto et al., 2018). MEG data records complex high-dimensional information about the brain network and the responding source locations, which is hard to collect with classic classification methods (Giovannetti et al., 2021). However, in the analysis period, it is a burden for researchers to do classification with MEG data: it is complex to correctly extract required signals during preprocessing, and lots of related experience is required when dealing with complex sensors and waveform patterns. Hence deep learning is expected to lighten the load of researchers, add the universal applicability of classification and increase the prediction accuracy. In this case, it is a challenge to choose the proper neural network.\n\n## Convolutional Neural Network\n\nThe CNN is a particular subtype of the neural network, which is effective in analysing images or other data containing high spatial information (Khan et al., 2018; Valueva et al., 2020) and also works well with temporal information (Bai et al., 2018). The same as the real neural networks in the brain, neurons in CNN process limited input data in a restricted receptive field and cooperate with each other by overlapping to cover the whole visual space (the filter extracting the features is called kernels). It is an automatic feature extraction process. Thus, it is now necessary to manually design feature extraction algorithms, which is required in traditional machine learning algorithms. It is also the main advantage of CNN to learn features from input data: avoiding the impact of artificial artefact in the algorithm design step. The main specialization of CNN is clearly the convolution part, which is a linear mathematic operation allowing extracting the nearby features of input data. The convolutional operation generates a series of machine-recognizable output features. It is suggested that the convolutional layer can be considered as a graphical pattern mining or feature extraction process (Li et al., 2018). What is more, previous research has shown the ability of CNN as a tool for analysing MEG data, which is in detail classifying brain activity and identifying potential neural sources (Zubarev et al., 2019). The process of generating the features map is following the sequential architecture, which is not like a cyclical recurrent neural network. A CNN model is usually composed of the input layer (the first layer where input data is passed in), multiple convolutional layers (feature extraction layers), alternative pooling layers (downsampling layer for feature maps), fully connecting layers (used to map the feature vectors obtained from previous feature extraction layers to the next layer), and output layers (the final layer where predictions are made). Inside each layer, activation functions are optional. A simple CNN network is shown as an example in figure 1. The convolutional layer receives input data, apply the convolution process to the data, and passes data to the following step. In the convolution function shown in equation 1, the f stands for input data; k stands for kernel filter, m, n respectively stands for the result matrix rows and columns index:\n\n$$\\begin{matrix}\nG\\lbrack m,\\ n\\rbrack = \\ (f*k)\\lbrack m,\\ n\\rbrack = \\ \\sum_{i = 1}^{m}\\ \\sum_{j = 1}^{n}\\ \\ k\\lbrack i,\\ j\\rbrack f\\lbrack m - i,\\ n - j\\rbrack\\ \\ (1) \\\\\n\\end{matrix}$$\n\nAs shown in figure 2 (A), a kernel filter is applied to the input data pixel: after summing up input values and filter, a result value is generated and passed to the next step. With all similar processes conducted step by step, a feature map is generated. Afterwards, the max pooling step (figure 2 (B)) comes to decrease the dimensions of data in order to keep more neurons activated which is reported to reduce the overfitting as well (Y. Huang et al., 2015).\n\n![image-20220824171734112](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202208241717167.png)\n\n**Figure 1.** A simple CNN architecture illustration (5 convolutional layers and pooling layers, 3 fully connected layers)\n\n![image-20220824171744899](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202208241717946.png)\n\n**Figure 2**. Convolution illustration (A), a 3\\*3 kernel filter (blue) is applied to a 6\\*6 input data (red) and give an output (green) as 4\\*4 (feature map). Max pooling illustration (B), data transformation is processed from 4\\*4 input to 2\\*2 output.\n\nIn previous research, sequence data were usually analysed with the recurrent neural network (RNN) while the convolutional neural network (CNN) was used for image prediction. However, recent works have demonstrated the effectiveness of CNN in time-sequential data (Bai et al., 2018) where CNN even have a longer effective memory. It provides us with the theoretical basis for utilizing various CNN models in behaviour prediction. CNN has also been used for MEG classification in recent years: previous research has successfully predicted different diseases such as brain tumours (Rajasree et al., 2021) and Alzheimer's disease (Aoe et al., 2019; Giovannetti et al., 2021). In fact, some studies have shown that CNN offers an unreplaceable advantage for patterns modelling those other techniques may not be disposed to reveal (Giovannetti et al., 2021). However, it is still an emergent topic to use deep learning instead of the classic machine learning method. As a special machine learning technique, deep learning benefits from the fast development of high-performance computation (HPC). One example is that deep learning can use the CUDA framework to accelerate training. As the GPU accelerators become more and more performance and energy-consuming effective (Faraji et al., 2016), the cheaper computation source becomes more and more available. Some evidence has shown that deep learning performs better than the classic machine learning methods when doing MEG classification (Aoe et al., 2019; RaviPrakash et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2020). In addition to these the ability to recognize temporal and spatial data patterns, CNN has the unique character of sharing weight among neurons in a convolutional layer (Anelli et al., 2021). In this case, the parameters quantity reduces sharply which benefits analysing complex structured MEG data.\n\n## Band power and Transfer learning\n\nCNNs are expected to have good performance for extracting features from MEG data, but the performance can be boosted by augmenting the data we feed into them. Here are some ways I did this with MEG data. MEG signals reflect brain activity, in which the brainwave can be deposed into different frequency power bands, such as delta (0.5-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (12-30Hz), and gamma (above 30 Hz). And these different brainwave frequency bands usually are associated with different brain states, such as the alpha band has been implicated in visual attention (Rohenkohl & Nobre, 2011). and the beta band is usually associated with anxiety (Einöther et al., 2013). That is why I think particular frequency bands might be important in helping classify accurately. In order to understand if it is available to extract critical information from the aversive state, it may be viable to extract different power bands and analyse them as a neural activity representation. One drawback of this method is it may reduce the available temporal information in MEG data, but it can not be denied that it provides an excellent and reliable method to study brain states (Newson & Thiagarajan, 2019).\n\nHowever, the trained model may not be suitable for data collected under other conditions. Between the MEG device and its recording source location, there are the skull, skin and even air, which may all affect the signals we get: the deeper source is, the more affected it will be. In addition to these confounds, the geometric shape of the skull which varies a lot between different people, also affects a lot (Hagemann et al., 2008). In order to generalize the model, power spectrum standardization and relative power computation are necessary. Moreover, it is reported that transfer learning can help to improve learning efficiency by reusing or transferring learnt parameters (Karimpanal & Bouffanais, 2018). In this case, transfer learning may reduce the influence of these confound factors and increase the generality of models.\n\nTransfer learning is the machine learning technique which allows a network to learn in one condition and improve its performance under another relevant condition. It is an optimization method to inform new task learning with relative learnt knowledge (Soria Olivas & IGI Global., 2010). For the transfer learning process, only part of the model parameters is trained and adjusted, which is called \"tuning\". If all network parameters are opened for training, it is easy to fall into the state of overfitting the target training set, thereby reducing the generalization performance of the model. The first few layers of the network are generally used for feature extraction. If the difference between the source task and the target task is not quite significant and the model has achieved good performance in the source task, there is no need to perform training from the beginning (Karimpanal & Bouffanais, 2018). In this case, the transfer learning technique solves the small data availability problem: with a small amount of data, it helps eliminate the overfitting problem and reduce the model training time. Some evidence suggests that it can keep at a high accuracy level and saves 90% time (Dash, Ferrari, et al., 2019). It has been widely used to transfer the weight or bias of the current network to a newly trained network with the object of faster convergence and better performance.\n\nFor aversive state reactivation prediction, previous studies have provided an approach with logistic regression methods and get a good accuracy (Wise et al., 2021) With a different approach (CNN) we could probably detect brain state reactivation with much better accuracy and learn a lot more about it. My first aim is to optimize the model with new techniques such as CNN and apply spectrum power. The second aim is to generalize the model by informing one participant model with other participants' data. I assume that: first, the performance of the CNN model is better than traditional machine learning models; second, adding the power spectrum to augment data will improve the performance as well.\n\n# Materials and Methods\n\n## Dataset\n\nThe participants, study design, data collection and preprocessing sections and relevant information are included and published in the paper \\\"Model-based aversive learning in humans is supported by preferential task state reactivation\\\" (Wise et al., 2021). Open access to the original MEG data can be found in the public repository: https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds003682. In total 28 participants took the task. The task is designed as follows: participants were required to sit with the MEG device in front of a monitor, where 14 images were shown. The recording duration of each stimulus is 1.29 seconds (from 0.5 before to 0.79 after image is shown). MEG data were collected with CTF 275-channel axial gradiometer system (CTF Omega, VSM MedTech). In the preprocessing session, the Maxwell filter was applied to remove noise firstly. Then a high pass filter above 0.5 Hz and a low pass filter below 45 Hz were applied. Afterwards, signal components were separated with independent component analysis (ICA) to isolate noise-related components in the setting of finding components which explain 95% variance. To reduce information loss, MEG data was upsampled and the window width of data was set as 800 time points (Aoe et al., 2019) when training the model to get better performance.\n\n## Power spectrum extraction\n\nIn order to compute the relative power (percentage power) of MEG signals, the first step is to extract the power band with the specific frequency. The frequency bands were chosen to be delta (0.5-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), low alpha (8-10 Hz), high alpha (8-12 Hz) beta (12-30 Hz), and gamma (above 30 Hz). Actually, the gamma frequency was below 50 Hz because it is impossible to detect any information above 50 Hz as the data are sampled at 100 Hz.\n\nFirstly the power spectral densities (PSD) and frequency of each band were derived using Welch's method with mne.time_frequency.psd_array_welch() function provided by MNE-Python (Percival & Walden, 1993; Slepian, 1978). The reason for choosing this function is this function gives a single value for each trial but other methods that give you power at each timepoint. Then the PSD of each band was integrated with the frequency as spacing point using composite Simpson's rule. The absolute power in a specific location is the average number of the power from several adjacent electrodes. The relative power is the ratio of the absolute power of a band to the total band power in all frequencies. As shown in equation 2, the r represents the relative power of a frequency band, the a stands for absolute power of the same frequency band, Pi 's are the absolute power in all frequency bands:\n\n$$\\begin{matrix}\nr = \\frac{a}{P_{t}} = \\ \\frac{a}{\\sum_{\\ }^{\\ }{P_{i}\\ }}\\ \\ (2) \\\\\n\\end{matrix}$$\n\nEventually, the absolute and relative power bands are transformed from input data in $\\mathbb{R}$C×T (where $\\mathbb{R}$ is a vector space) to $\\mathbb{R}$C×F, where C is the number of channels, T is time points and F is the number of frequency bands, i.e., 6 here.\n\n## Neural Network architecture\n\nIn order to classify different 14 categories brain states under 14 stimuli based on MEG signals, I proposed a CNN model ASRCNet-v1. The input data are MEG recordings from 24 subjects (4 were removed because of its information missing). In order to augment the data, the input of last fully connected layer was concatenated with relative power bands in all frequencies. The neural network structure of ASRCNet-v1 was developed based on the previously reported model EnvNet-v2 and MNet (Aoe et al., 2019; Tokozume et al., 2017; Tokozume & Harada, 2017), which was used to classify environmental sounds and Alzheimer's diseases. The detailed configuration of ASRNet-v1 is as demonstrated in figure 3 and the data processing is demonstrated in figure 4. There are three convolutional blocks in total: two feature extracting blocks: spatial and temporal blocks; and a CBAM block after them. In the first convolutional layer, the global features were extracted with a large filter, which has the same kernel width as the channel number of inputs. The kernel length of the first layer is set to be 64. The first layer generates a feature map in $\\mathbb{R}$S×1×T' from input data in $\\mathbb{R}$C×T, where the T is larger than T's. The C (number of channels) is larger than S (number of spatial filters) such that the channel dimension is reduced. The second convolutional layer in the spatial block generates a feature map in $\\mathbb{R}$S'×1×T'' with frequency features then. Afterwards, the data is downsampled with a max pooling layer and swapped along the axis between S and 1, i.e., from $\\mathbb{R}$S'×1×T'' to $\\mathbb{R}$`<!-- -->`{=html}1×S'×T''. This operation allows data being considered as the image changing the convolutional direction (Tokozume et al., 2017). The second block consists of eight convolutional layers and four max pooling layers. The kernel size of convolutional layers is small and decreases every two layers in order to extract local frequency temporal features from the output feature map from the previous layer. Relu is the activation function for all convolutional layers in the spatial block. Max pooling layers are attached after every two convolutional layers.\n\nThe attention block is composed of 2 parts: the channel attention module and the spatial attention module. Two modules help model focus more on the important information: channel dimension and spatial dimension. First, for the channel attention module, input data process average pooling and max pooling separately, where the average pooling layer is used to aggregate spatial information and the max pooling layer is used to maintain more extensive and precise context information as images' edges. The outputs are passed to an MLP (multilayer perceptron) network with the same weight. The MLP layer has a bottleneck. The width and length or the number of neurons in this MLP layer are decided by a reduction ratio of 16. Then the sum of two outputs from the MLP layer is given to the sigmoid activation function in order to project values in features map into $\\mathbb{R \\in}(0,1)$. Finally, the channel attention module returns a feature map as the product of input and calculated scale. Compared with the channel attention module, spatial attention seems to be simpler, which includes one convolutional layer and the sigmoid activation function. The same as the channel attention module, the spatial attention module returns a feature map as the product of input from the previous module and calculated scale in this module.\n\nThen the first fully connected layer (FC) comes to play the role of classifier, which is projecting the \"distributed feature representation\" of the feature map to sample labels space $\\mathbb{R}$L, where L is the number of features. In the object of data augmentation, the input is concatenated with relative power bands in all frequencies. The following step is another FC layer, which finally generates 14 features corresponding to the number of categories. At last, data is passed to the softmax activation function to convert the numbers vector into the probabilities vector. To avoid overfitting, 30 % dropout is applied after the last 4 spatial convolutional layers and 50 % dropout is applied after the first fully connected layer (Srivastava et al., 2014); batch normalization is applied to boost the speed of learning (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015).\n\n![image-20220824171834060](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202208241718131.png)\n\n**Figure 3**.

The original data is shaped as (64,1,272,800) where 64 is the number of batches, 272 is the number of channels and 800 is the number of time points.\n\n## Model training and testing\n\nThe input data is a total of 900 epochs of 800-time-point MEG signals from 272 channels. At the beginning, the data was separately processed directly with the neural network and the Fourier transformation. The latter process provides neural network with relative band power in frequency delta (0.5-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (12-30Hz), and gamma (above 30 Hz). The input data is shuffled and scaled with variance scaling method, which reasonably preserves the dynamic range of data, before being fed into the model. The first step is to normalize all input data for the reason that normalization step can generalize the statistical distribution of uniform samples, which is expected to enhance the training performance. The normalization process is as shown in equation 3, where m is the total number of data and x represents data, makes the average value and standard deviation of data in each channel to be located in the range between 0 and 1:\n\n$$\\begin{matrix}\n{x_{i}}^{'} = \\frac{\\left| x_{i} - \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{1}^{m}\\ x \\right|}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{1}^{m}\\ x^{2}}}\\ \\ (3) \\\\\n\\end{matrix}$$\n\nIn every training period, the input is one piece of a small segment of 64 batches of MEG signals segmented with non-overlapped 800-time-point time windows. The cross-entropy loss function was chosen to train the model because of its better performance in computing losses for discrete distributions. I chose SGD to be the optimizer because it is reported to have a better generalization capacity compared with Adam even though it may converge slower (Hardt et al., 2015). For the SGD optimizer, I set the initial learning rate as 0.0005, and momentum to 0.9. Specifically for the parameters in the second FF layer, a weight decay as 0.0005 is set keeping away from overfitting. The initial weight is randomized, which is because it is reported there is no obvious performance promotion with manually weight initialization (Hoshen et al., 2015). In order to improve training efficiency and avoid overfitting, I adapted the update step: I used the dynamic learning rate when the valid loss approaches a plateau (function 4, where $\\lambda$ represents learning decay and L represents valid loss). The patience of the dynamic learning rate is set to 1, the threshold is set to 0.001 and learning rate decay is set to 1e-8. Since there are a large number of features during training, in order to avert overfitting, I introduced L2 regularization (ridge regularization) with the regularization parameter lambda to 0.001. After the trial with model performance in different checkpoints, early stopping was finally adopted when the number of epochs reaches around 130 in case of overfitting.\n\n$$\\begin{matrix}\n\\alpha_{t + 1}\\  = \\ \\left\\{ \\begin{matrix}\n\\alpha_{t} \\times \\lambda & if\\ L_{t + 1} > \\ \\ L_{t} \\\\\n\\alpha_{t} & if\\ L_{t + 1} \\leq \\ \\ L_{t} \\\\\n\\end{matrix} \\right.\\ \\ \\ (4) \\\\\n\\end{matrix}$$\n\nFinally, the possibility of each label is generated in the model. It eventually gives only one \"most possible\" label after comparing the possibility in all labels. In order to prove the validity of this CNN model. ASRCNet-v1's performance is evaluated with 10-fold cross-validation, where 1 in 10 sets is used as validating set every time.\n\n# Result\n\nThe key results of the article are summarised and given in this section. This section first offers auxiliary findings with the whole dataset and furthermore demonstrates results using a single MEG dataset (i.e., a single subject). The accuracy measure is utilized to compare the performance of various models. All models had previously undergone testing on participant 1 to provide an initial indication of performance. The suggested model solution is validated across all of the participants once all models have been evaluated on participant 1. Additional tests are specifically run on the best model ASRCNet and other two main baseline models (LSTM RNN and simple CNN). For models tested on all subjects, model training was done within each participant, trained and evaluated only using its individual recording MEG data. Additionally, I set the windows of input data to 800 ms enabling an accurate comparison of several test models. Relative power spectrum is introduced to the training improving performance of models. Moreover, average topographical maps are graphed as the representation of the MEG signals intensities in the anatomical brain, illustrating the general topographic maps of brain states from different stimuli in brain states reactivation tasks.\n\n## Topographical map\n\nThe global anatomical brain maps are generated with concatenated dataset and were back fitted to MEG recordings. The average MEG signals with different stimuli are calculated and graphed showing commons and differences among various brain states under different stimuli. In the brain states reactivation process, under the different stimuli, the topographical maps all look very similar. There are subtle differences but in general the pattern is the same: similar brain regions are activated while to the different extent (figure 5). This means we need some kind of algorithm that is sensitive to these very small differences between stimuli.\n\nThe result shows the rationality of extracting features of brain states under different stimuli. It may suggest that stimulus representations are in the downstream temporal region or visual cortex. Thus, as the following training results showed, ASRCNet is an effective and reasonable approach to classifying these states.\n\n![image-20220824171924099](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202208241719153.png)\n\n**Figure 5**. brain topographical map under different stimuli in the specific time (0.36 s, 0.79 s after giving the stimuli). The average brain states of all 24 subjects in all 14 stimuli are shown as the topographical map. The map shows these different brain states as an intensity map, where the red colour shows stronger intensity and blue shows weaker intensity. The brain areas that are activated are concentrated in the downstream temporal region or visual cortex.\n\n## Power spectrum\n\nIn order to determine the effect of different brain wave frequencies, power spectral density (PSD) at all 272 channels is calculated. The 6 power bands are divided by the sum generating 1632 decoding features (272 channels for each of the 6 frequency bands). I analysed the power spectrum in all frequencies of input 800-time-point MEG signals for different participants. The results show that beta and delta waves are in the large and major proportion (figure 6). It may be considered as potential evidence that beta and delta waves are associated with not only anxious thinking, and active concentration (Baumeister et al., 2013), but also the aversive state. In the following classifier task, these findings are in line with results showing the involvement of beta and delta in concentration.\n\n![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202208241721133.gif)![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202208241720900.gif)\n\n**Figure 6.** Relative and absolute power spectrum (average of 24 subjects), beta (12 to 30 Hz) and delta (0.5 to 4 Hz) waves are in the major proportion\n\n## Classification of multiple brain states reactivations\n\nIn order to classify the brain states reactivation with different given image stimuli (figure 7), ASRCNet-v1, the classifier is developed. It is trained with MEG signals for each of the images. The representative MEG signals for each reactivation states that ASRCNet-v1 accurately identified is displayed in figure 8. A sample of an 800-time-point segment of the preprocessed MEG signals is displayed in the panel, where each contains 900 epochs. In these samples, there are no spikes or other distinctive abnormal waveforms. For every single training dataset from various participants, 900 of in total 900 events passed the rejection process. Therefore, none of these signals are removed because of bad channels. It is because the rejection algorithm was purposefully designed to be inclusive. All data were deliberately included because the CNN model should be robust to noise in the data. It is suggested that ASRCNet-v1 correctly categorised the MEG signals during aversive state by utilising features that not presents in the typical classification.\n\n![image-20220824172119017](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202208241721069.png)\n\n**Figure 7.** image stimuli in different brain states reactivation tasks (Wise et al., 2021), from left to right, above to bottom are labelled as stimulus_i.\n\n![image-20220824172132497](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202208241721550.png)\n\n**Figure 8.** representative MEG signal which is classified by the ASRCNet-v1 (from one sample participant)\n\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) (30 to 50 out of 272 channels) was tested to be applied to the input data before feeding data into the model. But the result shows that PCA does not obviously improve the classification performance of ASRCNet-v1. The classification accuracy was not obviously affected when PCA was applied. In the beginning, I didn\\'t get satisfactory learning convergence results. When the input data values are clipped to be in of standardized bounds, the learning curves became smooth and the valid loss gradually decreased step by step.\n\nSince there are 14 stimuli and the chances for all stimuli are equal, the random prediction accuracy is expected to be 7.14% (1/14 = 7.14%). The classification accuracy of ASRCNet-v1 is around 23.07%, which is clearly higher than random chance. LSTM RNN gives an accuracy of about 15.38% while simple CNN only gives a mean accuracy of 11.53%. I compared the performance of different models (figure 9) and found it is suggested that ASRCNet-v1 outperformed any other simple approach (LSTM RNN, simple CNN with 2 convolutional layers and 1 pooling layer). Compared with the other classification approach, ASRCNet-v1 exhibits the best classification performance (p = 6.8 × 10 --2 for LSTM RNN, p = 5.9 × 10 --2 for CNN, paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests). The best classification accuracy of ASRCNet-v1 is able to reach 33.33%. The classification accuracy variety between simple CNN and ASRCNet may suggest that the classification depends on some event-independent signal: the temporal and spatial features. To which extent the performance is a result of the detected differences in the temporal and spatial features of MEG signals, remained to be explored.\n\n![image-20220824172150882](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202208241721928.png)\n\n**Figure 9.** performance of different model boxplot. The boxplot shows the classification accuracy of different models. The random chance baseline is 7.14% (1/14 = 7.14%). All models learned from MEG signals (all accuracies are above 7.14% and gives better predictions. ASRCNet gives the best classification accuracy as 23.07%±7.69% (mean ± standard deviation).\n\n# Discussion\n\nIn this section, I am going to discuss the experimental results, findings, and potential future work. The focus of this paper is to explore the potential of deep learning, especially CNN to classify the aversive brain states associated with visual images. The MEG signals are complex and have low signal-to-noise ratios data structures. What is more, the aversive brain states parameters are continuous variables. Therefore, the aim is to solve a complex classification task. To optimally address this problem, a CNN model ASRCNet (inspired by Mnet and EnvNet, which was used in MEG data) is proposed as the deep learning solution in this research because of its ability to extract complex patterns from raw input data. One focus is to understand whether the CNN model is able to perform the decoding task. The analysis has been evaluated in two distinct steps: First, two well-known architectures (LSTM RNN and CNN: the former model is known as a good fit for sequential data and the second model is usually used in image classification) were selected as baseline models for the purpose of understanding the potential of general-purpose DL models that are not specific to MEG analysis. Second, I test the prediction and classification ability of the CNN-based architecture specially designed for MEG recordings. The results show that ASRCNet provide better performance compared to the other two baseline models. Since the model is specifically designed to extract features from MEG recordings, it can be considered an option in the field of brain state classification.\n\nI trained a novel deep neural network ASRCNet to classify 14 brain states using data from MEG recordings. It can distinguish brain states under different image stimuli with an accuracy at least as good as, or even higher than the baseline pipeline. ASRCNet allows the extraction of spatial and temporal information from the informative MEG data. It is suggested that classification decisions are unlikely to be associated with activities that are unrelated to the task itself, for example, mind wandering. The trained ASRCNet successfully classifies brain states with relatively high accuracy and specificity. Previous research has been focusing on common symptoms of psychopathology, but less on the domain of aversive states. This is a study using MEG signals to classify different aversive brain states with a classifier. The high specificity for all states suggests that ASRCNet will help improve our understanding of the human cognitive image process. One thing we can do with such a CNN classifier is to look at state reactivation in cognitive tasks. Moreover, this classifier is expected to be applied in clinical studies in order to diagnose nonorganic neurological diseases. As shown in the topological map in the result section, these brain states are hard to classify with the naked eyes. The information from such computer-aided diagnosis may be a novel biomarker for these diseases in clinical practice.\n\nThe advantage of using this neural network is its comprehensive training process, entirely based on gradient descent-based optimization without intermediate steps. As research develops toward explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), the parameters of a model may be going to have a direct and explainable connection to their task. On the separate brain states classification task, ASRCNet also performs on par with state-of-the-art, potentially making it a general method for other neuroimaging data. What is more, as shown in the result section, the classification accuracy varies a lot between simple image classification CNN and ASRCNet. One reason the model is successful in classification is that the first part of the network learns to extract the correct features, while the last layer classifies the extracted features. It may suggest that the classification of such brain states depends on some event-independent temporal and spatial features signal. Some evidence suggests that using features automatically extracted with deep learning models rather than manually selected, is able to help achieve the highest levels of accuracy compared to other machine learning approaches. It is reported that most of the best ImageNet is achieved by using some kind of data augmentation, instead of feature engineering and dimensionality reduction (de Bardeci et al., 2021). However, it was reported that logistic regression may achieve better classification accuracy than ASRCNet (Wise et al., 2021). It may be because of the algorithmic Incompleteness of the current model. Future work on improving the algorithm may improve the performance of CNN models.\n\nASRCNet is a relatively robust approach among different subjects. In this research, 14 different stimuli were applied to 24 subjects (data from 4 subjects were removed because of the smaller segment length). ASRCNet successfully classifies states in 24 different subjects with high accuracy, demonstrating the robustness of the CNN model. However, the data itself used in the research has potential for improvement: the 13th stimulus is a face picture, which may be different from other stimuli reflecting brain states (Rapcsak, 2019). What is more, it is concerned that the trained model may have difficulty classifying brain states using data recorded by another MEG scanner. Improvements in current source estimation and alignment techniques may make the method adaptable to different MEG scanners (Pettersen et al., 2006). Apart from the robustness, the size of the data itself may also affect the classification accuracy. A limitation of this experiment is, the same as in most other studies, the cross-validation approach was performed during the validation process, rather than using a separate test dataset. It was reported that using a separate test set in the DL model may help yield the highest level of validity in the results (de Bardeci et al., 2021). Although superficially, it is a relatively advanced practice to use data from the same subject in the training and test sets, there is room for improvement. A possible improvement is to create additional test sets beyond the limited availability of data. Due to the high inter-individual specificity and intra-individual stability of MEG data, it is difficult for the network to learn common features between subjects. The current approach of the model is to recognize different subjects by identifying individual MEG features of different subjects. Therefore, even though the network can achieve high levels of accuracy, classification and prediction will be unpredictable when it is applied to entirely new datasets from different subjects. The application of transfer learning methods with the small tuning of part of model parameters may be a possible solution. However, when performing transfer learning, it is generally assumed that different tasks are related. In this case, how to define the correlation and mathematically describe the strength of the correlation between tasks are subjective decisions that are biased toward researchers. The image classification-related studies usually use ImageNet as a pre-trained model for transfer learning because the large dataset of ImageNet itself ensures that the trained model has high generalization. But when we use a small dataset such as in this experiment, transfer learning may not only fail to achieve the expected result but result in negative transferring which is even worse than training a network from nowhere. For example, AlphaGo Zero learned from zero without any supervision or using chess manual data but achieves higher performance than AlphaGo Lee which is based on chess manual replays (Silver et al., 2017). Therefore, how to perform correct and effective transfer learning is one of the focuses of future work.\n\nDeep learning from scratch is often difficult with limited amounts of data. However, even with the limited amount of data in this study, I successfully classified 14 types of brain states. One reason for this success is that I enlarged the dataset by dividing each subject\\'s 1170 seconds of data into 900 segments of 1.3-second time data, allowing me to train 14 classes using approximately 25200 segments. The data amount is slightly less than the amount of MNIST, a database of handwritten digits that is often used to train deep neural networks, but still shows that I have a reasonable amount of data to train a network of such size (Yann LeCun et al., 2012). However, during the training process, the training data generally has a tendency to overfit even though I applied dropout (randomly ignored neurons in network) and batch normalization (normalizes input mini-batches from last layer). The proposed CNN model ASRCNet may benefit from the increase in dataset size. It improves with more training data because deep learning performance is reported to improve significantly with larger datasets (Greenspan et al., 2016). Therefore, it can be taken into account to train this model with more data in hopes of improving model performance. In addition, more research has shown that MEG and EEG provide complementary information, and other modalities such as MRI also provide additional useful information. Using data from multiple method sources at the same time may improve model performance (Dale & Sereno, 1993; Sharon et al., 2007). In future work, combining MEG signal data with EEG to create a multimodal data input may help improve the accuracy of brain states classification.\n\nIn this ASRCNet, the integration of the relative power spectrum improves the CNN model's performance. Since the beta and delta waves mainly encode perceptual information, the relative power spectrum ensemble adds relevant information to the model so that the different band power values can inform the network. Therefore, the model can adjust the weights accordingly. Additionally, the relative power spectrum may also add valuable information about artefacts or ambient noise (Anelli et al., 2021). All these deep learning models overfit the training dataset more or less, even applied regularization techniques like dropout and batch normalization. The additional information provided by the relative power spectrum ensemble helps the model to generalize. There is still room to improve the model's performance as the aspect of power spectrum extraction. In the process of relative power spectrum extraction, the wavelet transform can be considered as an optional alternative to Fourier analysis for the reason that the wavelet transform has the multi-scale analysis ability to extract features from the dataset and generate input images for training the model. Compared with the Fourier transform, the wavelet transform is a local transform of temporal and frequency data, so it can more effectively extract information from the signal by performing multi-scale refinement analysis with operations like scaling and translation (Yu & Guowen, 1994), thus has the potential to solve some difficult problems that Fourier transform cannot deal with. Fourier transform can only get a frequency spectrum, but wavelet transform can get a temporal frequency spectrum which not only the frequency can be obtained, but also the time can be located. Some recent studies successfully use the wavelet packet decomposition method to extract time-frequency features and use a dynamic frequency feature selection algorithm to select the most accurate features for each subject (Luo et al., 2016). However, other studies have shown the drawback of wavelet packet decomposition: although this method improves the classification accuracy, it requires a lot of work to select the most suitable features for each subject, and the feature extraction for different target individuals is poorly general (Dai et al., 2020). Only considering the power spectrum is quite limiting at the current moment. The convolutional operation executed by most popular machine learning libraries in deep learning is actually computing the correlation measurement (Graves, 2012). Future work investigating state classification and reactivation should also take steps to measure event-related desynchronization and synchronization in the context of the data generated.\n\nAnother idea to optimize the model is to replace the fully connected layer with global average pooling. The model holds a redundancy of fully connected layer parameters where fully connected layer parameters can account for about 80% of the entire network parameters. Some recent network models with excellent performance, such as ResNet, are trying to use global average pooling (GAP) layer instead of a fully connected layer for fusion. For the learned deep features, loss functions such as SoftMax are still used as the network objective function to guide the learning process (Liu & Zeng, 2022) Some evidence suggests that networks that replace a fully connected layer with a GAP layer may have better classification performance (Wei et al., 2018). However, other studies have pointed out that when applying transfer learning, the fine-tuned results of networks without fully connected layers are worse than those with fully connected layers. Therefore, fully connected can be regarded as a guard for model representation capabilities, especially in the case that there are big differences between the source domain and the target domain, the redundant parameters of FC can maintain a fine model capacity to ensure the migration of model representation capabilities (Zhang et al., 2018). Future work can explore the role of the GAP layer and fully connected layer in detail.\n\nASRCNet can extract and analyze features that deep learning neural networks use for classification, which may help researchers understand brain states better. The inherent hidden patterns in brain states and related brain neural activity that deep learning may reveal some fundamental mechanisms behind human behaviour. To the extent these can be explained, researchers are encouraged to apply these sophisticated deep learning modelling techniques to obtain accurate classification and prediction results and to generalize the results more carefully in a wider range of conditions. Moreover, understanding the relevant studies that extract these hidden patterns can increase and deepen our understanding of the brain state electrophysiological characterization.\n\n# Reference\n\nAnelli, M., Lauri, S.

In the clinical situation, tools to distinguish different diseases or states are required. However, classic classification methods have obvious shortcomings: traditional clinical categorical methods may not be competent for behaviour prediction or brain state classification and traditional machine learning models are improvable in classification accuracy. With the increasing use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) in neuroimaging computer-assisted classification, an ensemble classifier of CNNs might be able to mine hidden patterns from MEG signals. However, developing an effective brain state classifier is a difficult task owing to the non-Euclidean graphical nature of magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals.\n\nObjective: This project had two aims: 1) to develop a CNN-based model with better performance in classification than traditional machine learning models; 2) to test if the model can be improved with extra information adding relative power spectrum.\n\nMethods: To address this brain state classification modelling issue, I used MEG signals from 28 participants viewing 14 image stimuli to train the CNN. The CNN subsequently underwent 10-fold cross-validation to ensure proper classification of MEG. I also extracted the relative power spectrum and provided this to the network. The following main techniques were applied in this research, principal component analysis (PCA), convolutional block spatial and temporal features extracting modules, convolutional block attention module (CBAM) techniques, relative power spectrum (RPS) techniques, fully connected (FC) techniques.\n\nResults: In this research, my method was applied to the MEG dataset, the average classification accuracy is 23.07%±7.69%, which is much better than the baseline models: LSTM RNN model 15.38% (p = 6.8 × 10 ^--2^) and simple image classification CNN model 11.53% (p = 5.9 × 10 ^--2^). Relative power spectrum information (mainly beta and delta during this task) successfully informed the model improving its performance.\n\nConclusion: These results demonstrate that my method is feasible for the analysis and classification of brain states. It may help researchers diagnose people in the clinical situations and inform future neurological classification approaches in regard to higher specificity in identifying brain states.\n\n# Introduction\n\n## Machine learning in medical utilisation\n\nSince Donald Hebb first composed the cell assembly theory stating the consistency between neuronal activity and cognitive processes (Brown & Milner, 2003; Shaw, 1986), the idea of neural networks started to stand out in public visibility. Until Frank Rosenblatt first developed and explored the basic ingredients of deep learning (DL) (Tappert, 2019), the only constraint that can slow our steps are applications of math methods. The last past decades have seen the quick and great revolution of artificial intelligence as the development of computer science. What the big breakthrough takes us close to the scientific field are the powerful tools that teach machines to learn about the physical world. Even though machine learning techniques have gradually built their presence in recent decades, the application in medical utilisation lags.\n\nIn the past centuries, neuroscientists have always been attempting to classify and predict the brain's response to the visual world. Recently, with the rapid emergence of novel non-invasive techniques such as magnetoencephalography (MEG), electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), neuroscientists start to use these tools to solve the historical conundrum; and have made huge progress in the visual perceptual decoding or so-called \"brain-reading\" field (W. Huang et al., 2020). Each individual conscious experience is associated with a unique brain activity pattern so that it can be regarded as a fingerprint of specific brain activity. It is theoretically viable to read out one's current idea with a specifically designed computer vision and neuroimaging pattern (Haynes, 2012). In this case, it might be possible that these \"brain-reading\" techniques can tell us that could be helpful with regard to clinical applications. Nowadays, many neural mechanisms have been elucidated. Although the current studies are mostly on a reflective proof of concept track (Hedderich & Eickhoff, 2021), it is promising that these approaches will pave the way and build a solid foundation in regard to clinical applications. In contrast to the classic understanding of some mental mechanisms, more and more researchers believe that traditional categories systems may twist the real cause of diseases or behaviours (Bzdok & Meyer-Lindenberg, 2018). To fill this gap, deep learning techniques have been introduced into disease diagnosis and classification. It can avoid being affected by people's opinion bias but conversely get feedback from people so as to improve its learning ability from existing experience (Currie et al., 2019). Apart from disease classification, it is more profound to study human brain states under different conditions. Further studying of future state simulation has properly gained attention, especially on episodic future thought: the ability to rehearse events in mind, which may be going to happen in one's life trajectory (Schacter et al., 2017; Szpunar, 2010).\n\n## Aversive state reactivation and replay\n\nThe aversive state is critical for harm avoidance, playing a vital role in wilderness survival and social life (Terranova et al., 2022). As part of the aversive state, the observational fear process promotes one's capability of showing empathic fear when seeing other's aversive situations. This process may benefit from the neural replay and reactivation of individuals. The process that current state simulation reinforces the existing memory network is called \"reactivation\" while the neural activity activation is named \"neural replay\". The reactivation is based on past experience and in turn, promotes the storage of it, as well as facilitating the planning, inference and reward values updating (Wimmer & Shohamy, 2012; Wise et al., 2021). As mentioned in the previous section, one way to look at future thought simulation is to investigate memory reactivation.\n\nRecent works have shown that neural replay and reactivation are prior important in avoidance behaviour (Wu et al., 2017), which may provide individuals with a prospective prediction based on the possible consequence simulation (Doll et al., 2015). Since then, it is known \"which\" correlates to the aversive state, the following step is figuring out to what extent neuronal activity is associated with behaviour. Naturally, it encourages researchers to try predicting one's avoidance behaviour with the neuroimaging data recording. In recent years, more and more studies start to use neuroimaging classification to look for the inner mechanisms of brain states' reactivation (Belal et al., 2018; Eichenlaub et al., 2020; Roscow et al., 2021). If we want to look at memory reactivation, what we need is really good decoding methods with neuroimaging data recordings. So, it's important to optimise existing decoding methods as far as possible, which will set the scene for future related work.\n\n## Magnetoencephalography \n\nMagnetoencephalography (MEG) is useful for detecting brain states and evaluating the behavioural response. It allows us to map and locate specific brain areas and ongoing functions (Bunge & Kahn, 2009). The principle of MEG is based on magnetic induction. It is widely known that when neurons are activated, electrical signals will be generated synchronously. According to the magnetic induction principle, when the electrical fields change, secondary magnetic fields are generated. The brain-evoked magnetic field strength is usually in the range of femto-tesla to pico-tesla, i.e., 10--15 to 10-12 tesla (Singh, 2014). With the precise MEG device and mathematical preprocessing methods, these tiny signals are able to be separated from the noise and collected. MEG records magnetic fields, from which can be inferred changes in the transmission of postsynaptic current between cortical neurons.\n\nCompared to other neuroimaging methods, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has high spatial resolution but a low temporal resolution (Dash, Sao, et al., 2019); electroencephalography (EEG) records the electrical field that may twist between skin and skull, and EEG is based to reference point location hence it is sensitive to small measurement error. Electrocorticography (ECoG) is an invasive method, so it is not suitable for healthy participants and some patients; MEG stands out for its higher spatial, temporal resolution and dynamic time sequentiality. At the same time, MEG, as a non-invasive method, has its specific advantage: low preparation time, which supports a possibility for most clinical conditions. Furthermore, as novel portable MEG devices come out, it creates opportunity for various ages participants and patients (Boto et al., 2018). MEG data records complex high-dimensional information about the brain network and the responding source locations, which is hard to collect with classic classification methods (Giovannetti et al., 2021). However, in the analysis period, it is a burden for researchers to do classification with MEG data: it is complex to correctly extract required signals during preprocessing, and lots of related experience is required when dealing with complex sensors and waveform patterns. Hence deep learning is expected to lighten the load of researchers, add the universal applicability of classification and increase the prediction accuracy. In this case, it is a challenge to choose the proper neural network.\n\n## Convolutional Neural Network\n\nThe CNN is a particular subtype of the neural network, which is effective in analysing images or other data containing high spatial information (Khan et al., 2018; Valueva et al., 2020) and also works well with temporal information (Bai et al., 2018). The same as the real neural networks in the brain, neurons in CNN process limited input data in a restricted receptive field and cooperate with each other by overlapping to cover the whole visual space (the filter extracting the features is called kernels). It is an automatic feature extraction process. Thus, it is now necessary to manually design feature extraction algorithms, which is required in traditional machine learning algorithms. It is also the main advantage of CNN to learn features from input data: avoiding the impact of artificial artefact in the algorithm design step. The main specialization of CNN is clearly the convolution part, which is a linear mathematic operation allowing extracting the nearby features of input data. The convolutional operation generates a series of machine-recognizable output features. It is suggested that the convolutional layer can be considered as a graphical pattern mining or feature extraction process (Li et al., 2018). What is more, previous research has shown the ability of CNN as a tool for analysing MEG data, which is in detail classifying brain activity and identifying potential neural sources (Zubarev et al., 2019). The process of generating the features map is following the sequential architecture, which is not like a cyclical recurrent neural network. A CNN model is usually composed of the input layer (the first layer where input data is passed in), multiple convolutional layers (feature extraction layers), alternative pooling layers (downsampling layer for feature maps), fully connecting layers (used to map the feature vectors obtained from previous feature extraction layers to the next layer), and output layers (the final layer where predictions are made). Inside each layer, activation functions are optional. A simple CNN network is shown as an example in figure 1. The convolutional layer receives input data, apply the convolution process to the data, and passes data to the following step. In the convolution function shown in equation 1, the f stands for input data; k stands for kernel filter, m, n respectively stands for the result matrix rows and columns index:\n\n$$\\begin{matrix}\nG\\lbrack m,\\ n\\rbrack = \\ (f*k)\\lbrack m,\\ n\\rbrack = \\ \\sum_{i = 1}^{m}\\ \\sum_{j = 1}^{n}\\ \\ k\\lbrack i,\\ j\\rbrack f\\lbrack m - i,\\ n - j\\rbrack\\ \\ (1) \\\\\n\\end{matrix}$$\n\nAs shown in figure 2 (A), a kernel filter is applied to the input data pixel: after summing up input values and filter, a result value is generated and passed to the next step. With all similar processes conducted step by step, a feature map is generated. Afterwards, the max pooling step (figure 2 (B)) comes to decrease the dimensions of data in order to keep more neurons activated which is reported to reduce the overfitting as well (Y. Huang et al., 2015).\n\n![image-20220824171734112](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202208241717167.png)\n\n**Figure 1.** A simple CNN architecture illustration (5 convolutional layers and pooling layers, 3 fully connected layers)\n\n![image-20220824171744899](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202208241717946.png)\n\n**Figure 2**. Convolution illustration (A), a 3\\*3 kernel filter (blue) is applied to a 6\\*6 input data (red) and give an output (green) as 4\\*4 (feature map). Max pooling illustration (B), data transformation is processed from 4\\*4 input to 2\\*2 output.\n\nIn previous research, sequence data were usually analysed with the recurrent neural network (RNN) while the convolutional neural network (CNN) was used for image prediction. However, recent works have demonstrated the effectiveness of CNN in time-sequential data (Bai et al., 2018) where CNN even have a longer effective memory. It provides us with the theoretical basis for utilizing various CNN models in behaviour prediction. CNN has also been used for MEG classification in recent years: previous research has successfully predicted different diseases such as brain tumours (Rajasree et al., 2021) and Alzheimer's disease (Aoe et al., 2019; Giovannetti et al., 2021). In fact, some studies have shown that CNN offers an unreplaceable advantage for patterns modelling those other techniques may not be disposed to reveal (Giovannetti et al., 2021). However, it is still an emergent topic to use deep learning instead of the classic machine learning method. As a special machine learning technique, deep learning benefits from the fast development of high-performance computation (HPC). One example is that deep learning can use the CUDA framework to accelerate training. As the GPU accelerators become more and more performance and energy-consuming effective (Faraji et al., 2016), the cheaper computation source becomes more and more available. Some evidence has shown that deep learning performs better than the classic machine learning methods when doing MEG classification (Aoe et al., 2019; RaviPrakash et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2020). In addition to these the ability to recognize temporal and spatial data patterns, CNN has the unique character of sharing weight among neurons in a convolutional layer (Anelli et al., 2021). In this case, the parameters quantity reduces sharply which benefits analysing complex structured MEG data.\n\n## Band power and Transfer learning\n\nCNNs are expected to have good performance for extracting features from MEG data, but the performance can be boosted by augmenting the data we feed into them. Here are some ways I did this with MEG data. MEG signals reflect brain activity, in which the brainwave can be deposed into different frequency power bands, such as delta (0.5-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (12-30Hz), and gamma (above 30 Hz). And these different brainwave frequency bands usually are associated with different brain states, such as the alpha band has been implicated in visual attention (Rohenkohl & Nobre, 2011). and the beta band is usually associated with anxiety (Einöther et al., 2013). That is why I think particular frequency bands might be important in helping classify accurately. In order to understand if it is available to extract critical information from the aversive state, it may be viable to extract different power bands and analyse them as a neural activity representation. One drawback of this method is it may reduce the available temporal information in MEG data, but it can not be denied that it provides an excellent and reliable method to study brain states (Newson & Thiagarajan, 2019).\n\nHowever, the trained model may not be suitable for data collected under other conditions. Between the MEG device and its recording source location, there are the skull, skin and even air, which may all affect the signals we get: the deeper source is, the more affected it will be. In addition to these confounds, the geometric shape of the skull which varies a lot between different people, also affects a lot (Hagemann et al., 2008). In order to generalize the model, power spectrum standardization and relative power computation are necessary. Moreover, it is reported that transfer learning can help to improve learning efficiency by reusing or transferring learnt parameters (Karimpanal & Bouffanais, 2018). In this case, transfer learning may reduce the influence of these confound factors and increase the generality of models.\n\nTransfer learning is the machine learning technique which allows a network to learn in one condition and improve its performance under another relevant condition. It is an optimization method to inform new task learning with relative learnt knowledge (Soria Olivas & IGI Global., 2010). For the transfer learning process, only part of the model parameters is trained and adjusted, which is called \"tuning\". If all network parameters are opened for training, it is easy to fall into the state of overfitting the target training set, thereby reducing the generalization performance of the model. The first few layers of the network are generally used for feature extraction. If the difference between the source task and the target task is not quite significant and the model has achieved good performance in the source task, there is no need to perform training from the beginning (Karimpanal & Bouffanais, 2018). In this case, the transfer learning technique solves the small data availability problem: with a small amount of data, it helps eliminate the overfitting problem and reduce the model training time. Some evidence suggests that it can keep at a high accuracy level and saves 90% time (Dash, Ferrari, et al., 2019). It has been widely used to transfer the weight or bias of the current network to a newly trained network with the object of faster convergence and better performance.\n\nFor aversive state reactivation prediction, previous studies have provided an approach with logistic regression methods and get a good accuracy (Wise et al., 2021) With a different approach (CNN) we could probably detect brain state reactivation with much better accuracy and learn a lot more about it. My first aim is to optimize the model with new techniques such as CNN and apply spectrum power. The second aim is to generalize the model by informing one participant model with other participants' data. I assume that: first, the performance of the CNN model is better than traditional machine learning models; second, adding the power spectrum to augment data will improve the performance as well.\n\n# Materials and Methods\n\n## Dataset\n\nThe participants, study design, data collection and preprocessing sections and relevant information are included and published in the paper \\\"Model-based aversive learning in humans is supported by preferential task state reactivation\\\" (Wise et al., 2021). Open access to the original MEG data can be found in the public repository: https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds003682. In total 28 participants took the task. The task is designed as follows: participants were required to sit with the MEG device in front of a monitor, where 14 images were shown. The recording duration of each stimulus is 1.29 seconds (from 0.5 before to 0.79 after image is shown). MEG data were collected with CTF 275-channel axial gradiometer system (CTF Omega, VSM MedTech). In the preprocessing session, the Maxwell filter was applied to remove noise firstly. Then a high pass filter above 0.5 Hz and a low pass filter below 45 Hz were applied. Afterwards, signal components were separated with independent component analysis (ICA) to isolate noise-related components in the setting of finding components which explain 95% variance. To reduce information loss, MEG data was upsampled and the window width of data was set as 800 time points (Aoe et al., 2019) when training the model to get better performance.\n\n## Power spectrum extraction\n\nIn order to compute the relative power (percentage power) of MEG signals, the first step is to extract the power band with the specific frequency. The frequency bands were chosen to be delta (0.5-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), low alpha (8-10 Hz), high alpha (8-12 Hz) beta (12-30 Hz), and gamma (above 30 Hz). Actually, the gamma frequency was below 50 Hz because it is impossible to detect any information above 50 Hz as the data are sampled at 100 Hz.\n\nFirstly the power spectral densities (PSD) and frequency of each band were derived using Welch's method with mne.time_frequency.psd_array_welch() function provided by MNE-Python (Percival & Walden, 1993; Slepian, 1978). The reason for choosing this function is this function gives a single value for each trial but other methods that give you power at each timepoint. Then the PSD of each band was integrated with the frequency as spacing point using composite Simpson's rule. The absolute power in a specific location is the average number of the power from several adjacent electrodes. The relative power is the ratio of the absolute power of a band to the total band power in all frequencies. As shown in equation 2, the r represents the relative power of a frequency band, the a stands for absolute power of the same frequency band, Pi 's are the absolute power in all frequency bands:\n\n$$\\begin{matrix}\nr = \\frac{a}{P_{t}} = \\ \\frac{a}{\\sum_{\\ }^{\\ }{P_{i}\\ }}\\ \\ (2) \\\\\n\\end{matrix}$$\n\nEventually, the absolute and relative power bands are transformed from input data in $\\mathbb{R}$C×T (where $\\mathbb{R}$ is a vector space) to $\\mathbb{R}$C×F, where C is the number of channels, T is time points and F is the number of frequency bands, i.e., 6 here.\n\n## Neural Network architecture\n\nIn order to classify different 14 categories brain states under 14 stimuli based on MEG signals, I proposed a CNN model ASRCNet-v1. The input data are MEG recordings from 24 subjects (4 were removed because of its information missing). In order to augment the data, the input of last fully connected layer was concatenated with relative power bands in all frequencies. The neural network structure of ASRCNet-v1 was developed based on the previously reported model EnvNet-v2 and MNet (Aoe et al., 2019; Tokozume et al., 2017; Tokozume & Harada, 2017), which was used to classify environmental sounds and Alzheimer's diseases. The detailed configuration of ASRNet-v1 is as demonstrated in figure 3 and the data processing is demonstrated in figure 4. There are three convolutional blocks in total: two feature extracting blocks: spatial and temporal blocks; and a CBAM block after them. In the first convolutional layer, the global features were extracted with a large filter, which has the same kernel width as the channel number of inputs. The kernel length of the first layer is set to be 64. The first layer generates a feature map in $\\mathbb{R}$S×1×T' from input data in $\\mathbb{R}$C×T, where the T is larger than T's. The C (number of channels) is larger than S (number of spatial filters) such that the channel dimension is reduced. The second convolutional layer in the spatial block generates a feature map in $\\mathbb{R}$S'×1×T'' with frequency features then. Afterwards, the data is downsampled with a max pooling layer and swapped along the axis between S and 1, i.e., from $\\mathbb{R}$S'×1×T'' to $\\mathbb{R}$`<!-- -->`{=html}1×S'×T''. This operation allows data being considered as the image changing the convolutional direction (Tokozume et al., 2017). The second block consists of eight convolutional layers and four max pooling layers. The kernel size of convolutional layers is small and decreases every two layers in order to extract local frequency temporal features from the output feature map from the previous layer. Relu is the activation function for all convolutional layers in the spatial block. Max pooling layers are attached after every two convolutional layers.\n\nThe attention block is composed of 2 parts: the channel attention module and the spatial attention module. Two modules help model focus more on the important information: channel dimension and spatial dimension. First, for the channel attention module, input data process average pooling and max pooling separately, where the average pooling layer is used to aggregate spatial information and the max pooling layer is used to maintain more extensive and precise context information as images' edges. The outputs are passed to an MLP (multilayer perceptron) network with the same weight. The MLP layer has a bottleneck. The width and length or the number of neurons in this MLP layer are decided by a reduction ratio of 16. Then the sum of two outputs from the MLP layer is given to the sigmoid activation function in order to project values in features map into $\\mathbb{R \\in}(0,1)$. Finally, the channel attention module returns a feature map as the product of input and calculated scale. Compared with the channel attention module, spatial attention seems to be simpler, which includes one convolutional layer and the sigmoid activation function. The same as the channel attention module, the spatial attention module returns a feature map as the product of input from the previous module and calculated scale in this module.\n\nThen the first fully connected layer (FC) comes to play the role of classifier, which is projecting the \"distributed feature representation\" of the feature map to sample labels space $\\mathbb{R}$L, where L is the number of features. In the object of data augmentation, the input is concatenated with relative power bands in all frequencies. The following step is another FC layer, which finally generates 14 features corresponding to the number of categories. At last, data is passed to the softmax activation function to convert the numbers vector into the probabilities vector. To avoid overfitting, 30 % dropout is applied after the last 4 spatial convolutional layers and 50 % dropout is applied after the first fully connected layer (Srivastava et al., 2014); batch normalization is applied to boost the speed of learning (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015).\n\n![image-20220824171834060](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202208241718131.png)\n\n**Figure 3**. Detailed configuration of ASRCNet-v1.

The original data is shaped as (64,1,272,800) where 64 is the number of batches, 272 is the number of channels and 800 is the number of time points.\n\n## Model training and testing\n\nThe input data is a total of 900 epochs of 800-time-point MEG signals from 272 channels. At the beginning, the data was separately processed directly with the neural network and the Fourier transformation. The latter process provides neural network with relative band power in frequency delta (0.5-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (12-30Hz), and gamma (above 30 Hz). The input data is shuffled and scaled with variance scaling method, which reasonably preserves the dynamic range of data, before being fed into the model. The first step is to normalize all input data for the reason that normalization step can generalize the statistical distribution of uniform samples, which is expected to enhance the training performance. The normalization process is as shown in equation 3, where m is the total number of data and x represents data, makes the average value and standard deviation of data in each channel to be located in the range between 0 and 1:\n\n$$\\begin{matrix}\n{x_{i}}^{'} = \\frac{\\left| x_{i} - \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{1}^{m}\\ x \\right|}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{1}^{m}\\ x^{2}}}\\ \\ (3) \\\\\n\\end{matrix}$$\n\nIn every training period, the input is one piece of a small segment of 64 batches of MEG signals segmented with non-overlapped 800-time-point time windows. The cross-entropy loss function was chosen to train the model because of its better performance in computing losses for discrete distributions. I chose SGD to be the optimizer because it is reported to have a better generalization capacity compared with Adam even though it may converge slower (Hardt et al., 2015). For the SGD optimizer, I set the initial learning rate as 0.0005, and momentum to 0.9. Specifically for the parameters in the second FF layer, a weight decay as 0.0005 is set keeping away from overfitting. The initial weight is randomized, which is because it is reported there is no obvious performance promotion with manually weight initialization (Hoshen et al., 2015). In order to improve training efficiency and avoid overfitting, I adapted the update step: I used the dynamic learning rate when the valid loss approaches a plateau (function 4, where $\\lambda$ represents learning decay and L represents valid loss). The patience of the dynamic learning rate is set to 1, the threshold is set to 0.001 and learning rate decay is set to 1e-8. Since there are a large number of features during training, in order to avert overfitting, I introduced L2 regularization (ridge regularization) with the regularization parameter lambda to 0.001. After the trial with model performance in different checkpoints, early stopping was finally adopted when the number of epochs reaches around 130 in case of overfitting.\n\n$$\\begin{matrix}\n\\alpha_{t + 1}\\  = \\ \\left\\{ \\begin{matrix}\n\\alpha_{t} \\times \\lambda & if\\ L_{t + 1} > \\ \\ L_{t} \\\\\n\\alpha_{t} & if\\ L_{t + 1} \\leq \\ \\ L_{t} \\\\\n\\end{matrix} \\right.\\ \\ \\ (4) \\\\\n\\end{matrix}$$\n\nFinally, the possibility of each label is generated in the model. It eventually gives only one \"most possible\" label after comparing the possibility in all labels. In order to prove the validity of this CNN model. ASRCNet-v1's performance is evaluated with 10-fold cross-validation, where 1 in 10 sets is used as validating set every time.\n\n# Result\n\nThe key results of the article are summarised and given in this section. This section first offers auxiliary findings with the whole dataset and furthermore demonstrates results using a single MEG dataset (i.e., a single subject). The accuracy measure is utilized to compare the performance of various models. All models had previously undergone testing on participant 1 to provide an initial indication of performance. The suggested model solution is validated across all of the participants once all models have been evaluated on participant 1. Additional tests are specifically run on the best model ASRCNet and other two main baseline models (LSTM RNN and simple CNN). For models tested on all subjects, model training was done within each participant, trained and evaluated only using its individual recording MEG data. Additionally, I set the windows of input data to 800 ms enabling an accurate comparison of several test models. Relative power spectrum is introduced to the training improving performance of models. Moreover, average topographical maps are graphed as the representation of the MEG signals intensities in the anatomical brain, illustrating the general topographic maps of brain states from different stimuli in brain states reactivation tasks.\n\n## Topographical map\n\nThe global anatomical brain maps are generated with concatenated dataset and were back fitted to MEG recordings. The average MEG signals with different stimuli are calculated and graphed showing commons and differences among various brain states under different stimuli. In the brain states reactivation process, under the different stimuli, the topographical maps all look very similar. There are subtle differences but in general the pattern is the same: similar brain regions are activated while to the different extent (figure 5). This means we need some kind of algorithm that is sensitive to these very small differences between stimuli.\n\nThe result shows the rationality of extracting features of brain states under different stimuli. It may suggest that stimulus representations are in the downstream temporal region or visual cortex. Thus, as the following training results showed, ASRCNet is an effective and reasonable approach to classifying these states.\n\n![image-20220824171924099](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202208241719153.png)\n\n**Figure 5**. brain topographical map under different stimuli in the specific time (0.36 s, 0.79 s after giving the stimuli). The average brain states of all 24 subjects in all 14 stimuli are shown as the topographical map. The map shows these different brain states as an intensity map, where the red colour shows stronger intensity and blue shows weaker intensity. The brain areas that are activated are concentrated in the downstream temporal region or visual cortex.\n\n## Power spectrum\n\nIn order to determine the effect of different brain wave frequencies, power spectral density (PSD) at all 272 channels is calculated. The 6 power bands are divided by the sum generating 1632 decoding features (272 channels for each of the 6 frequency bands). I analysed the power spectrum in all frequencies of input 800-time-point MEG signals for different participants. The results show that beta and delta waves are in the large and major proportion (figure 6). It may be considered as potential evidence that beta and delta waves are associated with not only anxious thinking, and active concentration (Baumeister et al., 2013), but also the aversive state. In the following classifier task, these findings are in line with results showing the involvement of beta and delta in concentration.\n\n![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202208241721133.gif)![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202208241720900.gif)\n\n**Figure 6.** Relative and absolute power spectrum (average of 24 subjects), beta (12 to 30 Hz) and delta (0.5 to 4 Hz) waves are in the major proportion\n\n## Classification of multiple brain states reactivations\n\nIn order to classify the brain states reactivation with different given image stimuli (figure 7), ASRCNet-v1, the classifier is developed. It is trained with MEG signals for each of the images. The representative MEG signals for each reactivation states that ASRCNet-v1 accurately identified is displayed in figure 8. A sample of an 800-time-point segment of the preprocessed MEG signals is displayed in the panel, where each contains 900 epochs. In these samples, there are no spikes or other distinctive abnormal waveforms. For every single training dataset from various participants, 900 of in total 900 events passed the rejection process. Therefore, none of these signals are removed because of bad channels. It is because the rejection algorithm was purposefully designed to be inclusive. All data were deliberately included because the CNN model should be robust to noise in the data. It is suggested that ASRCNet-v1 correctly categorised the MEG signals during aversive state by utilising features that not presents in the typical classification.\n\n![image-20220824172119017](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202208241721069.png)\n\n**Figure 7.** image stimuli in different brain states reactivation tasks (Wise et al., 2021), from left to right, above to bottom are labelled as stimulus_i.\n\n![image-20220824172132497](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202208241721550.png)\n\n**Figure 8.** representative MEG signal which is classified by the ASRCNet-v1 (from one sample participant)\n\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) (30 to 50 out of 272 channels) was tested to be applied to the input data before feeding data into the model. But the result shows that PCA does not obviously improve the classification performance of ASRCNet-v1. The classification accuracy was not obviously affected when PCA was applied. In the beginning, I didn\\'t get satisfactory learning convergence results. When the input data values are clipped to be in of standardized bounds, the learning curves became smooth and the valid loss gradually decreased step by step.\n\nSince there are 14 stimuli and the chances for all stimuli are equal, the random prediction accuracy is expected to be 7.14% (1/14 = 7.14%). The classification accuracy of ASRCNet-v1 is around 23.07%, which is clearly higher than random chance. LSTM RNN gives an accuracy of about 15.38% while simple CNN only gives a mean accuracy of 11.53%. I compared the performance of different models (figure 9) and found it is suggested that ASRCNet-v1 outperformed any other simple approach (LSTM RNN, simple CNN with 2 convolutional layers and 1 pooling layer). Compared with the other classification approach, ASRCNet-v1 exhibits the best classification performance (p = 6.8 × 10 --2 for LSTM RNN, p = 5.9 × 10 --2 for CNN, paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests). The best classification accuracy of ASRCNet-v1 is able to reach 33.33%. The classification accuracy variety between simple CNN and ASRCNet may suggest that the classification depends on some event-independent signal: the temporal and spatial features. To which extent the performance is a result of the detected differences in the temporal and spatial features of MEG signals, remained to be explored.\n\n![image-20220824172150882](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202208241721928.png)\n\n**Figure 9.** performance of different model boxplot. The boxplot shows the classification accuracy of different models. The random chance baseline is 7.14% (1/14 = 7.14%). All models learned from MEG signals (all accuracies are above 7.14% and gives better predictions. ASRCNet gives the best classification accuracy as 23.07%±7.69% (mean ± standard deviation).\n\n# Discussion\n\nIn this section, I am going to discuss the experimental results, findings, and potential future work. The focus of this paper is to explore the potential of deep learning, especially CNN to classify the aversive brain states associated with visual images. The MEG signals are complex and have low signal-to-noise ratios data structures. What is more, the aversive brain states parameters are continuous variables. Therefore, the aim is to solve a complex classification task. To optimally address this problem, a CNN model ASRCNet (inspired by Mnet and EnvNet, which was used in MEG data) is proposed as the deep learning solution in this research because of its ability to extract complex patterns from raw input data. One focus is to understand whether the CNN model is able to perform the decoding task. The analysis has been evaluated in two distinct steps: First, two well-known architectures (LSTM RNN and CNN: the former model is known as a good fit for sequential data and the second model is usually used in image classification) were selected as baseline models for the purpose of understanding the potential of general-purpose DL models that are not specific to MEG analysis. Second, I test the prediction and classification ability of the CNN-based architecture specially designed for MEG recordings. The results show that ASRCNet provide better performance compared to the other two baseline models. Since the model is specifically designed to extract features from MEG recordings, it can be considered an option in the field of brain state classification.\n\nI trained a novel deep neural network ASRCNet to classify 14 brain states using data from MEG recordings. It can distinguish brain states under different image stimuli with an accuracy at least as good as, or even higher than the baseline pipeline. ASRCNet allows the extraction of spatial and temporal information from the informative MEG data. It is suggested that classification decisions are unlikely to be associated with activities that are unrelated to the task itself, for example, mind wandering. The trained ASRCNet successfully classifies brain states with relatively high accuracy and specificity. Previous research has been focusing on common symptoms of psychopathology, but less on the domain of aversive states. This is a study using MEG signals to classify different aversive brain states with a classifier. The high specificity for all states suggests that ASRCNet will help improve our understanding of the human cognitive image process. One thing we can do with such a CNN classifier is to look at state reactivation in cognitive tasks. Moreover, this classifier is expected to be applied in clinical studies in order to diagnose nonorganic neurological diseases. As shown in the topological map in the result section, these brain states are hard to classify with the naked eyes. The information from such computer-aided diagnosis may be a novel biomarker for these diseases in clinical practice.\n\nThe advantage of using this neural network is its comprehensive training process, entirely based on gradient descent-based optimization without intermediate steps. As research develops toward explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), the parameters of a model may be going to have a direct and explainable connection to their task. On the separate brain states classification task, ASRCNet also performs on par with state-of-the-art, potentially making it a general method for other neuroimaging data. What is more, as shown in the result section, the classification accuracy varies a lot between simple image classification CNN and ASRCNet. One reason the model is successful in classification is that the first part of the network learns to extract the correct features, while the last layer classifies the extracted features. It may suggest that the classification of such brain states depends on some event-independent temporal and spatial features signal. Some evidence suggests that using features automatically extracted with deep learning models rather than manually selected, is able to help achieve the highest levels of accuracy compared to other machine learning approaches. It is reported that most of the best ImageNet is achieved by using some kind of data augmentation, instead of feature engineering and dimensionality reduction (de Bardeci et al., 2021). However, it was reported that logistic regression may achieve better classification accuracy than ASRCNet (Wise et al., 2021). It may be because of the algorithmic Incompleteness of the current model. Future work on improving the algorithm may improve the performance of CNN models.\n\nASRCNet is a relatively robust approach among different subjects. In this research, 14 different stimuli were applied to 24 subjects (data from 4 subjects were removed because of the smaller segment length). ASRCNet successfully classifies states in 24 different subjects with high accuracy, demonstrating the robustness of the CNN model. However, the data itself used in the research has potential for improvement: the 13th stimulus is a face picture, which may be different from other stimuli reflecting brain states (Rapcsak, 2019). What is more, it is concerned that the trained model may have difficulty classifying brain states using data recorded by another MEG scanner. Improvements in current source estimation and alignment techniques may make the method adaptable to different MEG scanners (Pettersen et al., 2006). Apart from the robustness, the size of the data itself may also affect the classification accuracy. A limitation of this experiment is, the same as in most other studies, the cross-validation approach was performed during the validation process, rather than using a separate test dataset. It was reported that using a separate test set in the DL model may help yield the highest level of validity in the results (de Bardeci et al., 2021). Although superficially, it is a relatively advanced practice to use data from the same subject in the training and test sets, there is room for improvement. A possible improvement is to create additional test sets beyond the limited availability of data. Due to the high inter-individual specificity and intra-individual stability of MEG data, it is difficult for the network to learn common features between subjects. The current approach of the model is to recognize different subjects by identifying individual MEG features of different subjects. Therefore, even though the network can achieve high levels of accuracy, classification and prediction will be unpredictable when it is applied to entirely new datasets from different subjects. The application of transfer learning methods with the small tuning of part of model parameters may be a possible solution. However, when performing transfer learning, it is generally assumed that different tasks are related. In this case, how to define the correlation and mathematically describe the strength of the correlation between tasks are subjective decisions that are biased toward researchers. The image classification-related studies usually use ImageNet as a pre-trained model for transfer learning because the large dataset of ImageNet itself ensures that the trained model has high generalization. But when we use a small dataset such as in this experiment, transfer learning may not only fail to achieve the expected result but result in negative transferring which is even worse than training a network from nowhere. For example, AlphaGo Zero learned from zero without any supervision or using chess manual data but achieves higher performance than AlphaGo Lee which is based on chess manual replays (Silver et al., 2017). Therefore, how to perform correct and effective transfer learning is one of the focuses of future work.\n\nDeep learning from scratch is often difficult with limited amounts of data. However, even with the limited amount of data in this study, I successfully classified 14 types of brain states. One reason for this success is that I enlarged the dataset by dividing each subject\\'s 1170 seconds of data into 900 segments of 1.3-second time data, allowing me to train 14 classes using approximately 25200 segments. The data amount is slightly less than the amount of MNIST, a database of handwritten digits that is often used to train deep neural networks, but still shows that I have a reasonable amount of data to train a network of such size (Yann LeCun et al., 2012). However, during the training process, the training data generally has a tendency to overfit even though I applied dropout (randomly ignored neurons in network) and batch normalization (normalizes input mini-batches from last layer). The proposed CNN model ASRCNet may benefit from the increase in dataset size. It improves with more training data because deep learning performance is reported to improve significantly with larger datasets (Greenspan et al., 2016). Therefore, it can be taken into account to train this model with more data in hopes of improving model performance. In addition, more research has shown that MEG and EEG provide complementary information, and other modalities such as MRI also provide additional useful information. Using data from multiple method sources at the same time may improve model performance (Dale & Sereno, 1993; Sharon et al., 2007). In future work, combining MEG signal data with EEG to create a multimodal data input may help improve the accuracy of brain states classification.\n\nIn this ASRCNet, the integration of the relative power spectrum improves the CNN model's performance. Since the beta and delta waves mainly encode perceptual information, the relative power spectrum ensemble adds relevant information to the model so that the different band power values can inform the network. Therefore, the model can adjust the weights accordingly. Additionally, the relative power spectrum may also add valuable information about artefacts or ambient noise (Anelli et al., 2021). All these deep learning models overfit the training dataset more or less, even applied regularization techniques like dropout and batch normalization. The additional information provided by the relative power spectrum ensemble helps the model to generalize. There is still room to improve the model's performance as the aspect of power spectrum extraction. In the process of relative power spectrum extraction, the wavelet transform can be considered as an optional alternative to Fourier analysis for the reason that the wavelet transform has the multi-scale analysis ability to extract features from the dataset and generate input images for training the model. Compared with the Fourier transform, the wavelet transform is a local transform of temporal and frequency data, so it can more effectively extract information from the signal by performing multi-scale refinement analysis with operations like scaling and translation (Yu & Guowen, 1994), thus has the potential to solve some difficult problems that Fourier transform cannot deal with. Fourier transform can only get a frequency spectrum, but wavelet transform can get a temporal frequency spectrum which not only the frequency can be obtained, but also the time can be located. Some recent studies successfully use the wavelet packet decomposition method to extract time-frequency features and use a dynamic frequency feature selection algorithm to select the most accurate features for each subject (Luo et al., 2016). However, other studies have shown the drawback of wavelet packet decomposition: although this method improves the classification accuracy, it requires a lot of work to select the most suitable features for each subject, and the feature extraction for different target individuals is poorly general (Dai et al., 2020). Only considering the power spectrum is quite limiting at the current moment. The convolutional operation executed by most popular machine learning libraries in deep learning is actually computing the correlation measurement (Graves, 2012). Future work investigating state classification and reactivation should also take steps to measure event-related desynchronization and synchronization in the context of the data generated.\n\nAnother idea to optimize the model is to replace the fully connected layer with global average pooling. The model holds a redundancy of fully connected layer parameters where fully connected layer parameters can account for about 80% of the entire network parameters. Some recent network models with excellent performance, such as ResNet, are trying to use global average pooling (GAP) layer instead of a fully connected layer for fusion. For the learned deep features, loss functions such as SoftMax are still used as the network objective function to guide the learning process (Liu & Zeng, 2022) Some evidence suggests that networks that replace a fully connected layer with a GAP layer may have better classification performance (Wei et al., 2018). However, other studies have pointed out that when applying transfer learning, the fine-tuned results of networks without fully connected layers are worse than those with fully connected layers. Therefore, fully connected can be regarded as a guard for model representation capabilities, especially in the case that there are big differences between the source domain and the target domain, the redundant parameters of FC can maintain a fine model capacity to ensure the migration of model representation capabilities (Zhang et al., 2018). Future work can explore the role of the GAP layer and fully connected layer in detail.\n\nASRCNet can extract and analyze features that deep learning neural networks use for classification, which may help researchers understand brain states better. The inherent hidden patterns in brain states and related brain neural activity that deep learning may reveal some fundamental mechanisms behind human behaviour. To the extent these can be explained, researchers are encouraged to apply these sophisticated deep learning modelling techniques to obtain accurate classification and prediction results and to generalize the results more carefully in a wider range of conditions. Moreover, understanding the relevant studies that extract these hidden patterns can increase and deepen our understanding of the brain state electrophysiological characterization.\n\n# Reference\n\nAnelli, M., Lauri, S.

Build a model - train - predict\n\nDefine the module method `KNeighborsClassifier()`, use `fit` to train `training data`, this step completes all the steps of training, the latter `knn` is already a trained model, which can be used directly `predict` For the data of the test set, comparing the value predicted by the model with the real value, we can see that the data is roughly simulated, but there is an error, and the prediction will not be completely correct.\n\n```python\nknn = KNeighborsClassifier()\nknn.fit(X_train, y_train)\nprint(knn.predict(X_test))\nprint(y_test)\n\n\"\"\"\n[2 0 0 1 2 2 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 1 2 1 2 1 0 0 0 2 1 2 0 0 0 0 1 0 2 0 0 2 1 0 1\n 0 0 1 0 1 2 0 1]\n[2 0 0 1 2 1 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 1 2 1 2 1 0 0 0 2 1 2 0 0 0 0 1 0 2 0 0 2 1 0 1\n 0 0 1 0 1 2 0 1]\n \"\"\"\n```\n\nDirectly download the data and store in my computer. However, it is unprofessional to run code in personal computer. I should looking for a way to solve this problem: rent a server or find a HPC cluster in King’s College.\n\n![image-20220425150724894](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202204251507965.png)\n\n## Succeed at drawing plot\n\n```python\nimport mne\nimport os\nfrom mne.datasets import sample\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# The storage path of sample\ndata_path = sample.data_path()\n# The storage path of the fif file\nfname = 'E:\\Proj\\Previous data\\sample\\MEG\\sample\\sub-001_localiser_sub-001_ses-01_task-AversiveLearningReplay_run-localiser_proc_ICA-epo.fif.gz'\n\nepochs = mne.read_epochs(fname)\n\nprint(epochs.event_id)\n\npicks = mne.pick_types(epochs.info, meg=True, ref_meg=False, exclude='bads')\n\nepochs.plot(block=True)\n\nepochs.plot_drop_log()\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\n```python\nepochs = mne.read_epochs(fname)\n\nevoked = epochs.average()\nevoked.plot_topomap()\n\nplt.show()\n```\n```python\navailabe_event = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 32]\n\nfor i in availabe_event:\n    evoked_i = epochs[i].average(picks=picks)\n    epochs_i = epochs[i]\n    evoked_i.plot(time_unit='s')\n    plt.show()\n\n```\n\nThe panel each contains 900 epochs. In these samples, there are no spikes or other distinctive abnormal waveforms. For every single training dataset from various participants, 900 of in total 900 events passed the rejection process. It is because the rejection algorithm was purposefully designed to be inclusive. All data were deliberately included because the CNN model should be robust to noise in the data\n\n![image-20220817193732989](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202208171937606.png)\n\nTopological map from -500.00 to 790.00 ms.

It is better to apply regularization to the layers with the highest parameters.\n\nIn the above case, how to get each layer’s parameters?\n\n```python\nfrom prettytable import PrettyTable\n\ndef count_parameters(model):\n    table = PrettyTable([\"Modules\", \"Parameters\"])\n    total_params = 0\n    for name, parameter in model.named_parameters():\n        if not parameter.requires_grad: continue\n        params = parameter.numel()\n        table.add_row([name, params])\n        total_params+=params\n    print(table)\n    print(f\"Total Trainable Params: {total_params}\")\n    return total_params\n    \ncount_parameters(model)\n```\n\n# May 2nd\n\n## Question ahead:\n\nget a question: how to determine the classifier centre (windows width)? \n\nfor this case, it is around 20 to be at the middle/ top\n\nGPU accelerations\n\nIt could be a little bit tricky to accelerate the calculation in sklearn with GPU. Here is a possible solution: https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/scikit-learn-tutorial-beginners-guide-to-gpu-accelerating-ml-pipelines/.  \n\n## Third meeting:\n\nDeep learning might be the solution for MEG signals classification. \n\nThe CNN is a particular subtype of the neural network, which is effective in analysing images or other data containing high spatial information (Khan et al., 2018; Valueva et al., 2020) and also works well with temporal information (Bai et al., 2018)\n\n> Khan, S., Rahmani, H., Shah, S.

One hallmark is to increase the mean accuracy of each cases as high as possible.\n\n# May 3rd\n\nSuccessfully run the code for confusion matrix.\n\n```python\nclf.set_params(**random_search.best_params_)\n\n# Get predictions with 5 fold CV\ny_pred = cross_val_predict(clf, X, y, cv=confusion_matrix_cv)\nmean_conf_mat = confusion_matrix(y, y_pred)\nmean_accuracy = accuracy_score(y[y != 99], y_pred[y != 99])\nmean_conf_mat = mean_conf_mat.astype('float') / mean_conf_mat.sum(axis=1)  # normalise\n\nprint(\"Mean accuracy = {0}\".format(mean_accuracy))\n    \n# Plot mean confusion matrix\n#plot_confusion_matrix(mean_conf_mat[:n_stim, :n_stim], title='Normalised confusion matrix, accuracy = {0}'.format(np.round(mean_accuracy, 2)))\n#plt.imshow(mean_conf_mat[:n_stim, :n_stim])\n\nConfusionMatrixDisplay.from_predictions(y, y_pred)\nplt.savefig('./save_folder/fig-{}.png'.format(session_id), dpi=600)\nplt.show()\n```\n\npictures of each case are stored in the Github depository: \n\nhttps://github.com/ReveRoyl/MT_ML_Decoding/tree/main/Aversive_state_reactivation/notebooks/templates/save_folder\n\nIt takes around 36 minutes to run 28 cases. \n\nMean accuracy with existing code:\n\n```python\n[0.4288888888888889, 0.33666666666666667, 0.2777777777777778, 0.5022222222222222, 0.5066666666666667, 0.4245810055865922, 0.5577777777777778, 0.43222222222222223, 0.65, 0.47888888888888886, 0.3377777777777778, 0.4800469483568075, 0.27111111111111114, 0.37193763919821826, 0.4288888888888889, 0.40555555555555556, 0.46444444444444444, 0.7077777777777777, 0.5811111111111111, 0.4711111111111111, 0.4255555555555556, 0.5022222222222222, 0.45394006659267483, 0.38555555555555554, 0.6222222222222222, 0.4622222222222222, 0.35444444444444445, 0.47444444444444445]\n```\n# May 10th\n\nGet rid of the effect of null data\n\ntransform X into the same size as clf\n\n# May 11th\n\n## Grid Search CV\n\nTo test Grid Search CV instead of Randomized Search CV\n\nHowever, the result of grid search CV is worse than the randomized search CV. I think the reason is that random search CV uses a random combination of hyperparameters to find the best solution for a built model. However, the random search CV is not 100% better than grid search CV: the disadvantage of random search is that it produces high variance during computation.\n\n## Concatenation\n\n### Objective\n\nSince my aim is to transfer the model prediction of one case to anther, I try to concatenate multiple cases data together to train the model and see what will happen.\n\n```python\nlocaliser_epochs = mne.read_epochs(os.path.join(output_dir, 'preprocessing', 'sub-{}', 'localiser', 'sub-{}_ses-01_task-AversiveLearningReplay_run-localiser_proc_ICA-epo.fif.gz').format('001','001')) \n\nfor session_id_int in range(2, 3):\n    session_id = '{:03d}'.format(session_id_int)\n    print(session_id)\n    \n    localiser_epochs_unconcatenate = mne.read_epochs(os.path.join(output_dir, 'preprocessing', 'sub-{}', 'localiser', 'sub-{}_ses-01_task-AversiveLearningReplay_run-localiser_proc_ICA-epo.fif.gz').format(session_id,session_id))  \n    localiser_epochs_unconcatenate.info = localiser_epochs.info\n    localiser_epochs = mne.concatenate_epochs([localiser_epochs, localiser_epochs_unconcatenate]) \n\n```\n\n### Result\n\nConcatenate X np arrays and test, the mean accuracy increases.

Some research is also using Tensorflow as their machine learning library. But I found Pytorch is a more popular packages which allows me to get access to more well-known templates. Most related research is using Pytorch as their machine learning library.\n\nHowever, I found the variable and  placeholder operations are more commonly used in Tensorflow-v1 rather than the latest  Tensorflow-v1\n\n### Session control\n\nIn Tensorflow, a string is defined as a variable, and it is a variable, which is different from Python. (later on I found it was correct in Tensorflow v1 but changes in Tensorflow v2)\n\n `state = tf.Variable()`\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\nstate = tf.Variable(0, name='counter')\n\n# define variable one\none = tf.constant(1)\n\n# define plus step (hint: no computation here)\nnew_value = tf.add(state, one)\n\n# update State to new_value\nupdate = tf.assign(state, new_value)\n```\n\nIf I set variables in Tensorflow, initializing the variables is the most important thing! ! So after defining the variable, be sure to define `init = tf.initialize_all_variables()`.\n\nAt this point, the variable is still not activated, and it needs to be added in `sess` , `sess.run(init)` , to activate`init`. (again, it changes in v2, we do not need to initialize the session in Tensorflow v2)\n\n```Python\n# Variable, initialize\n# init = tf.initialize_all_variables() # expired\ninit = tf.global_variables_initializer()  \n \n# Session\nwith tf.Session() as sess:\n    sess.run(init)\n    for _ in range(3):\n        sess.run(update)\n        print(sess.run(state))\n\n```\n\nNote: directly `print(state)` does not work! !\n\nBe sure to point the `sess` pointer to `state` and then `print` to get the desired result!\n\n### placeholder\n\n`placeholder` is a placeholder in Tensorflow that temporarily stores variables.\n\nIf Tensorflow wants to pass in data from the outside, it needs to use `tf.placeholder()`, and then transfer the data in this form `sess.run(***, feed_dict={input: **})`.\n\nExamoles：\n\n```\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Tensorflow requires defining placeholder's type, usually float32\ninput1 = tf.placeholder(tf.float32)\ninput2 = tf.placeholder(tf.float32)\n\n# multiply input1 and input2\nouput = tf.multiply(input1, input2)\n```\n\nNext, the work of passing the value is handed over to `sess.run()`, the value that needs to be passed in is placed in `feed_dict={}` and corresponds to each `input` one by one. `placeholder` and `feed_dict={ }` are bound together.\n\n```\nwith tf.Session() as sess:\n    print(sess.run(ouput, feed_dict={input1: [7.], input2: [2.]}))\n# [ 14.]\n```\n\n### Activation function\n\nwhen there are many layers, be careful to use activation function in case of the **gradient exploding or gradient disappearance**.\n\n# May 28th\n\n> Although in the computer vision field convolutional layer often followed by a pooling layer to reduce the data dimension at the expense of information loss, in the scenes of MEG decoding, the size of MEG data is much smaller than the computer vision field. So in order to keep all the information, we don’t use the pooling layer. After the spatial convolutional layer, we use two layers of temporal convolutional layers to extract temporal features, a fully connected layer with dropout operation for feature fusion, and a softmax layer for final classification. (Huang2019)\n\nIt is important to select if we should use pooling layers and how many to use.\n\n# May 30th\n\n## ML optimizer\n\n### Objective:\n\nto learn how to use and select different optimizer, because it modifies model’s parameters like weights and learning rate, which helps to increase accuracy and reduce overall loss.\n\n### Results:\n\n- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)\n- Momentum\n- AdaGrad\n- RMSProp\n- Adam\n\n![speedup3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202205302233928.png)\n\nX.shape gives (n_epochs, n_channels, n_times) corresponding to (batches, pixels,channels)  of images\n\nApart for optimizer, scheduler may help a lot with providing a dynamic learning rate.\n\n### impression\n\nAs I tried to apply regularization at the same time. It is important to bear in mind, if we give a momentum in SGD (about 0.9), we can easily apply L2 regularization when the weight_decay is larger than 0.\n\n# May 31st\n\n### Objective:\n\nto learn data augmentation and learn a important rule: “No free lunch theorem”\n\n### Results:\n\nD. H. Wolpert et. al. (1995) come up with “No free lunch theorem”: all optimization algorithms perform equally well when their performance is averaged across all possible problems.\n\nFor any prediction function, if it performs well on some training samples, it must perform poorly on other training samples. If there are certain assumptions about the prior distribution of the data in the feature space, there are as many good and bad performances.\n\nLater I found relative power spectrum including delta (0.5-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (12-30Hz), and gamma (above 30 Hz), provide important information to augmenting the MEG data.\n\n```python\nX_train_numpy = X_train_tensors.cpu().numpy()\nX_test_numpy = X_test_tensors.cpu().numpy()\n\nX = np.swapaxes(X_train_numpy, 2, -1).squeeze()\ndata = X[X.shape[0]-1, 70, :]\npsd_mne, freqs_mne = psd_array_welch(data, 100, 1., 70., n_per_seg=None,\n                          n_overlap=0, n_jobs=1)\nfor low, high in [(0.5, 4), (4, 8), (8, 10), (10, 12), (12, 30),\n                  (30, 70)]:\n    print(\"processing bands (low, high) : ({},{})\".format(low, high))\n    # Find intersecting values in frequency vector\n    idx_delta = np.logical_and(freqs_mne >= low, freqs_mne <= high)\n      # Frequency resolution\n    freq_res = freqs_mne[1] - freqs_mne[0]  # = 1 / 4 = 0.25\n\n    # Compute the absolute power by approximating the area under the curve\n    power = simps(psd_mne[idx_delta], dx=freq_res)\n    print('Absolute power: {:.4f} uV^2'.format(power))\n    \n    total_power = simps(psd_mne, dx=freq_res)\n    rel_power = power / total_power\n    \n    print('Relative power: {:.4f}'.format(rel_power))\n```\n\n# Jun 1st\n\n## Seventh meeting\n\nDr Toby provide me the code to load data with dataloader\n\nit defines load_MEG_dataset function with following parameters: \n\n```python\ndef load_MEG_dataset(\n        subject_ids: List[str],\n        mode: str = \"individual\",\n        output_format: str = \"numpy\",\n        trial_data_format: str = \"2D\",\n        data_location: str = \"./data/\",\n        center_timepoint: int = 20,\n        window_width: List[int] = [-400, 400],\n        shuffle: bool = False,\n        pca_n_components: int = None,\n        training: bool = True,\n        train_test_split: float = 0.75,\n        batch_size: int = 32,\n        scale: bool = True,\n        seed: int = 0,\n    )\n```\n\n# Jun 6th\n\n### Objective:\n\nto try different loss function, because different evaluating methods may affect the learning process, and lead to a different approach to training results.\n\n### Results:\n\nwhen apply other loss function instead of CrossEntropy, there are some format error occurs:\n\nsolution: transform inputs from multi hot coding into one hot coding. \n\n```Python\ndef onehot(batches, n_classes, y):\n  yn = torch.zeros(batches, n_classes)\n  for i in range(batches):\n    x = [0 for j in range(batches)]\n    x[i] = y[i]/2-1                     #ex.

It is the experience gained from Dr Toby. Even though I found the others’ research about hands behaviour prediction used MSE loss. It is not suitable for our results because theirs is about the movements while ours is not.\n\n# Jun 9th\n\n## Label noise.\n\n### Objectives:\n\nto figure out if labels format it self may affect the model performance. Because some models only accept data in one kind of format. \n\n**question**: how to determine numbers of hidden layers in LSTM RNN.\n\n### Results:\n\nWe cannot correctly compare each label when we are using **one-hot format**. If the labels you predict are apples, bananas, and strawberries, obviously they do not directly have a comparison relationship. If we use 1, 2, 3 as labels, there will be a comparison relationship between the labels. Distances are different. With the comparison relationship, the distance between the first label and the last label is too far, which affects the learning of the model.\n\nOne promotion:\n\n> Knowledge distillation (KD) improves performance precisely by suppressing this label nosie. Based on this understanding, we introduce a particularly simple improvement method of knowledge disillation, which can significantly improve the performance of ordinary KD by setting different temperatures for each image. \n>\n> Xu, K., Rui, L., Li, Y., Gu, L.

It seems the validation loss does not converge. I decide the next step is going to do more literature research and adjust the parameters.\n\n# Jun 13th\n\n### Problems:\n\nthe problem is overfitting. There could be 2 alternative options: 1, get more data; 2, try different learning rate or dynamic learning rate.\n\nthe way the train-test split worked wasn't ideal in the data loading function - because the data wasn't shuffled prior to splitting, the train and test set would often consist of different subjects if we load multiple subjects. The data can be shuffled before splitting (by setting shuffle=True), which means that there will be a mix of subjects in both the training and testing data. This seems to boost accuracy in the test set a little bit.\n\n# Jun 14th\n\n### Objective:\n\nto try `CosineEmbeddingLoss()` because it is reported that cosine loss may improve the performance for small dataset\n\n> Cosine loss could have better performance for small dataset (around 30%). \n>\n> Barz, B., & Denzler, J.

Multilayer Perceptron\n\n2. transfer learning\n\n# Jun 16th\n\n>  **Convolutional Layer** : Consider a convolutional layer which takes “l” feature maps as the input and has “k” feature maps as output. The filter size is “**n\\*m**”.\n> Here the input has ***l=32\\*** feature maps as inputs, ***k=64\\*** feature maps as outputs and filter size is ***n=3 and m=3\\***. It is important to understand, that we don’t simply have a 3*3 filter, but actually, we have **3\\*3\\*32** filter, as our input has 32 dimensions. And as an output from first conv layer, we learn 64 different **3\\*3\\*32** filters which total weights is “**n\\*m\\*k\\*l**”. Then there is a term called bias for each feature map. So, the total number of parameters are “**(n\\*m\\*l+1)\\*k**”.\n>\n> https://medium.com/@iamvarman/how-to-calculate-the-number-of-parameters-in-the-cnn-5bd55364d7ca\n\nbicubic interpolation: torch.nn.functional.interpolate() with mode='bicubic' \n\n> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54083474/bicubic-interpolation-in-pytorch\n\nMeeting these data and fitting problems, I realize the insufficiency of understanding data itself, so I look back to the Machine Learning courses materials from 2 years ago, trying to get some new approaches.\n\nWhen reading the Chapter 1 of *Computational Modelling of Cognition and Behaviour*, I get the following points: \n\n> 1. Data never speak for themselves but require a model to be understood and to be explained.\n> 2. Verbal theorizing alone ultimately cannot replace for quantitative analysis.\n> 3. There are always several alternative models that vie for explanation of data and we must select among them.\n> 4.

The classification accuracy of my model is around 23.07%, which is clearly higher than random chance. LSTM RNN gives an accuracy of about 15.38% while simple CNN only gives a mean accuracy of 11.53%. Compared with the other classification approach, my model exhibits the best classification performance (p = 6.8 × 10 –2 for LSTM RNN, p = 5.9 × 10 –2 for CNN, paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests).

Build a model - train - predict\n\nDefine the module method `KNeighborsClassifier()`, use `fit` to train `training data`, this step completes all the steps of training, the latter `knn` is already a trained model, which can be used directly `predict` For the data of the test set, comparing the value predicted by the model with the real value, we can see that the data is roughly simulated, but there is an error, and the prediction will not be completely correct.\n\n```python\nknn = KNeighborsClassifier()\nknn.fit(X_train, y_train)\nprint(knn.predict(X_test))\nprint(y_test)\n\n\"\"\"\n[2 0 0 1 2 2 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 1 2 1 2 1 0 0 0 2 1 2 0 0 0 0 1 0 2 0 0 2 1 0 1\n 0 0 1 0 1 2 0 1]\n[2 0 0 1 2 1 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 1 2 1 2 1 0 0 0 2 1 2 0 0 0 0 1 0 2 0 0 2 1 0 1\n 0 0 1 0 1 2 0 1]\n \"\"\"\n```\n\nDirectly download the data and store in my computer. However, it is unprofessional to run code in personal computer. I should looking for a way to solve this problem: rent a server or find a HPC cluster in King’s College.\n\n![image-20220425150724894](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202204251507965.png)\n\n## Succeed at drawing plot\n\n```python\nimport mne\nimport os\nfrom mne.datasets import sample\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# The storage path of sample\ndata_path = sample.data_path()\n# The storage path of the fif file\nfname = 'E:\\Proj\\Previous data\\sample\\MEG\\sample\\sub-001_localiser_sub-001_ses-01_task-AversiveLearningReplay_run-localiser_proc_ICA-epo.fif.gz'\n\nepochs = mne.read_epochs(fname)\n\nprint(epochs.event_id)\n\npicks = mne.pick_types(epochs.info, meg=True, ref_meg=False, exclude='bads')\n\nepochs.plot(block=True)\n\nepochs.plot_drop_log()\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\n```python\nepochs = mne.read_epochs(fname)\n\nevoked = epochs.average()\nevoked.plot_topomap()\n\nplt.show()\n```\n```python\navailabe_event = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 32]\n\nfor i in availabe_event:\n    evoked_i = epochs[i].average(picks=picks)\n    epochs_i = epochs[i]\n    evoked_i.plot(time_unit='s')\n    plt.show()\n\n```\n\nThe panel each contains 900 epochs. In these samples, there are no spikes or other distinctive abnormal waveforms. For every single training dataset from various participants, 900 of in total 900 events passed the rejection process.

It is better to apply regularization to the layers with the highest parameters.\n\nIn the above case, how to get each layer’s parameters?\n\n```python\nfrom prettytable import PrettyTable\n\ndef count_parameters(model):\n    table = PrettyTable([\"Modules\", \"Parameters\"])\n    total_params = 0\n    for name, parameter in model.named_parameters():\n        if not parameter.requires_grad: continue\n        params = parameter.numel()\n        table.add_row([name, params])\n        total_params+=params\n    print(table)\n    print(f\"Total Trainable Params: {total_params}\")\n    return total_params\n    \ncount_parameters(model)\n```\n\n# May 2nd\n\n## Question ahead:\n\nget a question: how to determine the classifier centre (windows width)? \n\nfor this case, it is around 20 to be at the middle/ top\n\nGPU accelerations\n\nIt could be a little bit tricky to accelerate the calculation in sklearn with GPU. Here is a possible solution: https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/scikit-learn-tutorial-beginners-guide-to-gpu-accelerating-ml-pipelines/.  \n\n## Third meeting:\n\nDeep learning might be the solution for MEG signals classification. \n\nThe CNN is a particular subtype of the neural network, which is effective in analysing images or other data containing high spatial information (Khan et al., 2018; Valueva et al., 2020) and also works well with temporal information (Bai et al., 2018)\n\n> Khan, S., Rahmani, H., Shah, S.

I think the reason is that random search CV uses a random combination of hyperparameters to find the best solution for a built model. However, the random search CV is not 100% better than grid search CV: the disadvantage of random search is that it produces high variance during computation.\n\n## Concatenation\n\n### Objective\n\nSince my aim is to transfer the model prediction of one case to anther, I try to concatenate multiple cases data together to train the model and see what will happen.\n\n```python\nlocaliser_epochs = mne.read_epochs(os.path.join(output_dir, 'preprocessing', 'sub-{}', 'localiser', 'sub-{}_ses-01_task-AversiveLearningReplay_run-localiser_proc_ICA-epo.fif.gz').format('001','001')) \n\nfor session_id_int in range(2, 3):\n    session_id = '{:03d}'.format(session_id_int)\n    print(session_id)\n    \n    localiser_epochs_unconcatenate = mne.read_epochs(os.path.join(output_dir, 'preprocessing', 'sub-{}', 'localiser', 'sub-{}_ses-01_task-AversiveLearningReplay_run-localiser_proc_ICA-epo.fif.gz').format(session_id,session_id))  \n    localiser_epochs_unconcatenate.info = localiser_epochs.info\n    localiser_epochs = mne.concatenate_epochs([localiser_epochs, localiser_epochs_unconcatenate]) \n\n```\n\n### Result\n\nConcatenate X np arrays and test, the mean accuracy increases.

Some research is also using Tensorflow as their machine learning library. But I found Pytorch is a more popular packages which allows me to get access to more well-known templates. Most related research is using Pytorch as their machine learning library.\n\nHowever, I found the variable and  placeholder operations are more commonly used in Tensorflow-v1 rather than the latest  Tensorflow-v1\n\n### Session control\n\nIn Tensorflow, a string is defined as a variable, and it is a variable, which is different from Python. (later on I found it was correct in Tensorflow v1 but changes in Tensorflow v2)\n\n `state = tf.Variable()`\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\nstate = tf.Variable(0, name='counter')\n\n# define variable one\none = tf.constant(1)\n\n# define plus step (hint: no computation here)\nnew_value = tf.add(state, one)\n\n# update State to new_value\nupdate = tf.assign(state, new_value)\n```\n\nIf I set variables in Tensorflow, initializing the variables is the most important thing! ! So after defining the variable, be sure to define `init = tf.initialize_all_variables()`.\n\nAt this point, the variable is still not activated, and it needs to be added in `sess` , `sess.run(init)` , to activate`init`. (again, it changes in v2, we do not need to initialize the session in Tensorflow v2)\n\n```Python\n# Variable, initialize\n# init = tf.initialize_all_variables() # expired\ninit = tf.global_variables_initializer()  \n \n# Session\nwith tf.Session() as sess:\n    sess.run(init)\n    for _ in range(3):\n        sess.run(update)\n        print(sess.run(state))\n\n```\n\nNote: directly `print(state)` does not work! !\n\nBe sure to point the `sess` pointer to `state` and then `print` to get the desired result!\n\n### placeholder\n\n`placeholder` is a placeholder in Tensorflow that temporarily stores variables.\n\nIf Tensorflow wants to pass in data from the outside, it needs to use `tf.placeholder()`, and then transfer the data in this form `sess.run(***, feed_dict={input: **})`.\n\nExamoles：\n\n```\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Tensorflow requires defining placeholder's type, usually float32\ninput1 = tf.placeholder(tf.float32)\ninput2 = tf.placeholder(tf.float32)\n\n# multiply input1 and input2\nouput = tf.multiply(input1, input2)\n```\n\nNext, the work of passing the value is handed over to `sess.run()`, the value that needs to be passed in is placed in `feed_dict={}` and corresponds to each `input` one by one. `placeholder` and `feed_dict={ }` are bound together.\n\n```\nwith tf.Session() as sess:\n    print(sess.run(ouput, feed_dict={input1: [7.], input2: [2.]}))\n# [ 14.]\n```\n\n### Activation function\n\nwhen there are many layers, be careful to use activation function in case of the **gradient exploding or gradient disappearance**.\n\n# May 28th\n\n> Although in the computer vision field convolutional layer often followed by a pooling layer to reduce the data dimension at the expense of information loss, in the scenes of MEG decoding, the size of MEG data is much smaller than the computer vision field. So in order to keep all the information, we don’t use the pooling layer. After the spatial convolutional layer, we use two layers of temporal convolutional layers to extract temporal features, a fully connected layer with dropout operation for feature fusion, and a softmax layer for final classification. (Huang2019)\n\nIt is important to select if we should use pooling layers and how many to use.\n\n# May 30th\n\n## ML optimizer\n\n### Objective:\n\nto learn how to use and select different optimizer, because it modifies model’s parameters like weights and learning rate, which helps to increase accuracy and reduce overall loss.\n\n### Results:\n\n- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)\n- Momentum\n- AdaGrad\n- RMSProp\n- Adam\n\n![speedup3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReveRoyl/PictureBed/main/BlogImg/202205302233928.png)\n\nX.shape gives (n_epochs, n_channels, n_times) corresponding to (batches, pixels,channels)  of images\n\nApart for optimizer, scheduler may help a lot with providing a dynamic learning rate.\n\n### impression\n\nAs I tried to apply regularization at the same time. It is important to bear in mind, if we give a momentum in SGD (about 0.9), we can easily apply L2 regularization when the weight_decay is larger than 0.\n\n# May 31st\n\n### Objective:\n\nto learn data augmentation and learn a important rule: “No free lunch theorem”\n\n### Results:\n\nD. H. Wolpert et. al. (1995) come up with “No free lunch theorem”: all optimization algorithms perform equally well when their performance is averaged across all possible problems.\n\nFor any prediction function, if it performs well on some training samples, it must perform poorly on other training samples. If there are certain assumptions about the prior distribution of the data in the feature space, there are as many good and bad performances.\n\nLater I found relative power spectrum including delta (0.5-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (12-30Hz), and gamma (above 30 Hz), provide important information to augmenting the MEG data.\n\n```python\nX_train_numpy = X_train_tensors.cpu().numpy()\nX_test_numpy = X_test_tensors.cpu().numpy()\n\nX = np.swapaxes(X_train_numpy, 2, -1).squeeze()\ndata = X[X.shape[0]-1, 70, :]\npsd_mne, freqs_mne = psd_array_welch(data, 100, 1., 70., n_per_seg=None,\n                          n_overlap=0, n_jobs=1)\nfor low, high in [(0.5, 4), (4, 8), (8, 10), (10, 12), (12, 30),\n                  (30, 70)]:\n    print(\"processing bands (low, high) : ({},{})\".format(low, high))\n    # Find intersecting values in frequency vector\n    idx_delta = np.logical_and(freqs_mne >= low, freqs_mne <= high)\n      # Frequency resolution\n    freq_res = freqs_mne[1] - freqs_mne[0]  # = 1 / 4 = 0.25\n\n    # Compute the absolute power by approximating the area under the curve\n    power = simps(psd_mne[idx_delta], dx=freq_res)\n    print('Absolute power: {:.4f} uV^2'.format(power))\n    \n    total_power = simps(psd_mne, dx=freq_res)\n    rel_power = power / total_power\n    \n    print('Relative power: {:.4f}'.format(rel_power))\n```\n\n# Jun 1st\n\n## Seventh meeting\n\nDr Toby provide me the code to load data with dataloader\n\nit defines load_MEG_dataset function with following parameters: \n\n```python\ndef load_MEG_dataset(\n        subject_ids: List[str],\n        mode: str = \"individual\",\n        output_format: str = \"numpy\",\n        trial_data_format: str = \"2D\",\n        data_location: str = \"./data/\",\n        center_timepoint: int = 20,\n        window_width: List[int] = [-400, 400],\n        shuffle: bool = False,\n        pca_n_components: int = None,\n        training: bool = True,\n        train_test_split: float = 0.75,\n        batch_size: int = 32,\n        scale: bool = True,\n        seed: int = 0,\n    )\n```\n\n# Jun 6th\n\n### Objective:\n\nto try different loss function, because different evaluating methods may affect the learning process, and lead to a different approach to training results.\n\n### Results:\n\nwhen apply other loss function instead of CrossEntropy, there are some format error occurs:\n\nsolution: transform inputs from multi hot coding into one hot coding. \n\n```Python\ndef onehot(batches, n_classes, y):\n  yn = torch.zeros(batches, n_classes)\n  for i in range(batches):\n    x = [0 for j in range(batches)]\n    x[i] = y[i]/2-1                     #ex.

It is the experience gained from Dr Toby. Even though I found the others’ research about hands behaviour prediction used MSE loss. It is not suitable for our results because theirs is about the movements while ours is not.\n\n# Jun 9th\n\n## Label noise.\n\n### Objectives:\n\nto figure out if labels format it self may affect the model performance. Because some models only accept data in one kind of format. \n\n**question**: how to determine numbers of hidden layers in LSTM RNN.\n\n### Results:\n\nWe cannot correctly compare each label when we are using **one-hot format**. If the labels you predict are apples, bananas, and strawberries, obviously they do not directly have a comparison relationship. If we use 1, 2, 3 as labels, there will be a comparison relationship between the labels. Distances are different. With the comparison relationship, the distance between the first label and the last label is too far, which affects the learning of the model.\n\nOne promotion:\n\n> Knowledge distillation (KD) improves performance precisely by suppressing this label nosie. Based on this understanding, we introduce a particularly simple improvement method of knowledge disillation, which can significantly improve the performance of ordinary KD by setting different temperatures for each image. \n>\n> Xu, K., Rui, L., Li, Y., Gu, L.

It seems the validation loss does not converge. I decide the next step is going to do more literature research and adjust the parameters.\n\n# Jun 13th\n\n### Problems:\n\nthe problem is overfitting. There could be 2 alternative options: 1, get more data; 2, try different learning rate or dynamic learning rate.\n\nthe way the train-test split worked wasn't ideal in the data loading function - because the data wasn't shuffled prior to splitting, the train and test set would often consist of different subjects if we load multiple subjects. The data can be shuffled before splitting (by setting shuffle=True), which means that there will be a mix of subjects in both the training and testing data. This seems to boost accuracy in the test set a little bit.\n\n# Jun 14th\n\n### Objective:\n\nto try `CosineEmbeddingLoss()` because it is reported that cosine loss may improve the performance for small dataset\n\n> Cosine loss could have better performance for small dataset (around 30%). \n>\n> Barz, B., & Denzler, J.

Multilayer Perceptron\n\n2. transfer learning\n\n# Jun 16th\n\n>  **Convolutional Layer** : Consider a convolutional layer which takes “l” feature maps as the input and has “k” feature maps as output. The filter size is “**n\\*m**”.\n> Here the input has ***l=32\\*** feature maps as inputs, ***k=64\\*** feature maps as outputs and filter size is ***n=3 and m=3\\***. It is important to understand, that we don’t simply have a 3*3 filter, but actually, we have **3\\*3\\*32** filter, as our input has 32 dimensions. And as an output from first conv layer, we learn 64 different **3\\*3\\*32** filters which total weights is “**n\\*m\\*k\\*l**”. Then there is a term called bias for each feature map. So, the total number of parameters are “**(n\\*m\\*l+1)\\*k**”.\n>\n> https://medium.com/@iamvarman/how-to-calculate-the-number-of-parameters-in-the-cnn-5bd55364d7ca\n\nbicubic interpolation: torch.nn.functional.interpolate() with mode='bicubic' \n\n> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54083474/bicubic-interpolation-in-pytorch\n\nMeeting these data and fitting problems, I realize the insufficiency of understanding data itself, so I look back to the Machine Learning courses materials from 2 years ago, trying to get some new approaches.\n\nWhen reading the Chapter 1 of *Computational Modelling of Cognition and Behaviour*, I get the following points: \n\n> 1. Data never speak for themselves but require a model to be understood and to be explained.\n> 2. Verbal theorizing alone ultimately cannot replace for quantitative analysis.\n> 3. There are always several alternative models that vie for explanation of data and we must select among them.\n> 4.

It may be considered as potential evidence that beta and delta waves are associated with not only anxious thinking, and active concentration (Baumeister et al., 2013), but also the aversive state. In the following classifier task, these findings are in line with results showing the involvement of beta and delta in concentration.\n\n> Baumeister, J., Barthel, T., Geiss, K. R., & Weiss, M.

The classification accuracy of my model is around 23.07%, which is clearly higher than random chance. LSTM RNN gives an accuracy of about 15.38% while simple CNN only gives a mean accuracy of 11.53%.
